  "wiki_text": "<this city> (UK: , US: ; Hungarian pronunciation: [\u02c8bud\u0252p\u025b\u0283t] (listen)) is the capital and most populous city of <this country>. It is the ninth-largest city in the European Union by population within city limits and the second-largest city on the Danube river; the city has an estimated population of 1,752,286 over a land area of about 525 square kilometres (203 square miles). <this city>, which is both a city and county, forms the centre of the <this city> metropolitan area, which has an area of 7,626 square kilometres (2,944 square miles) and a population of 3,303,786. It is a primate city, constituting 33% of the population of <this country>.The history of <this city> began when an early Celtic settlement transformed into the Roman town of Aquincum, the capital of Lower Pannonia. The Hungarians arrived in the territory in the late 9th century, but the area was pillaged by the Mongols in 1241\u201342. Re-established Buda became one of the centres of Renaissance humanist culture by the 15th century. The Battle of Moh\u00e1cs, in 1526, was followed by nearly 150 years of Ottoman rule. After the reconquest of Buda in 1686, the region entered a new age of prosperity, with Pest-Buda becoming a global city after the unification of Buda, \u00d3buda and Pest on 17 November 1873, with the name '<this city>' given to the new capital. <this city> also became the co-capital of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, a great power that dissolved in 1918, following World War I. The city was the focal point of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 and the Battle of <this city> in 1945, as well as the Hungarian Revolution of 1956.<this city> is a global city with strengths in commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment. <this country>'s financial centre, <this city> is also the headquarters of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology, the European Police College and the first foreign office of the China Investment Promotion Agency. Over 40 colleges and universities are located in <this city>, including E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University, Corvinus University, Semmelweis University, University of Veterinary Medicine <this city> and the <this city> University of Technology and Economics. Opened in 1896, the city's subway system, the <this city> Metro, serves 1.27 million, while the <this city> Tram Network serves 1.08 million passengers daily.The central area of <this city> along the Danube River is classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and has several notable monuments of classical architecture, including the Hungarian Parliament and the Buda Castle. The city also has around 80 geothermal springs, the largest thermal water cave system, second largest synagogue, and third largest Parliament building in the world. <this city> attracts around 12 million international tourists per year, making it a highly popular destination in Europe.\n\nEtymology and pronunciation\nThe previously separate towns of Buda, \u00d3buda, and Pest were officially unified in 1873 and given the new name <this city>. Before this, the towns together had sometimes been referred to colloquially as \"Pest-Buda\". Pest is used pars pro toto for the entire city in contemporary colloquial Hungarian.All varieties of English pronounce the -s- as in the English word pest. The -u in Buda- is pronounced either /u/ like food (as in US: ) or /ju/ like cue (as in UK: ). In Hungarian, the -s- is pronounced /\u0283/ as in wash; in IPA: Hungarian: [\u02c8bud\u0252p\u025b\u0283t] (listen).\nThe origins of the names \"Buda\" and \"Pest\" are obscure. Buda was\n\nprobably the name of the first constable of the fortress built on the Castle Hill in the 11th century\nor a derivative of Bod or Bud, a personal name of Turkic origin, meaning 'twig'.\nor a Slavic personal name, Buda, the short form of Budim\u00edr, Budivoj.Linguistically, however, a German origin through the Slavic derivative \u0432\u043e\u0434\u0430 (voda, water) is not possible, and there is no certainty that a Turkic word really comes from the word buta ~ buda 'branch, twig'.According to a legend recorded in chronicles from the Middle Ages, \"Buda\" comes from the name of its founder, Bleda, brother of Hunnic ruler Attila.\n\nAttila went in the city of Sicambria in Pannonia, where he killed Buda, his brother, and he threw his corpse into the Danube. For while Attila was in the west, his brother crossed the boundaries in his reign, because he named Sicambria after his own name Buda's Castle. And though King Attila forbade the Huns and the other peoples to call that city Buda's Castle, but he called it Attila's Capital, the Germans who were terrified by the prohibition named the city as Eccylburg, which means Attila Castle, however, the Hungarians did not care about the ban and call it \u00d3buda [Old Buda] and call it to this day.\nThe Scythians are certainly an ancient people and the strength of Scythia lies in the east, as we said above. And the first king of Scythia was Magog, son of Japhet, and his people were called Magyars [Hungarians] after their King Magog, from whose royal line the most renowned and mighty King Attila descended, who, in the 451st year of Our Lord's birth, coming down from Scythia, entered Pannonia with a mighty force and, putting the Romans to flight, took the realm and made a royal residence for himself beside the Danube above the hot springs, and he ordered all the old buildings that he found there to be restored and he built them in a circular and very strong wall that in the Hungarian language is now called Budav\u00e1r [Buda Castle] and by the Germans Etzelburg [Attila Castle]\nThere are several theories about Pest. One states that the name derives from Roman times, since there was a local fortress (Contra-Aquincum) called by Ptolemy \"Pession\" (\"\u03a0\u03ad\u03c3\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd\", iii.7.\u00a7 2). Another has it that Pest originates in the Slavic word for cave, \u043f\u0435\u0449\u0435\u0440\u0430, or pe\u0161tera. A third cites \u043f\u0435\u0449, or pe\u0161t, referencing a cave where fires burned or a limekiln.\n\nHistory\nEarly history\nThe first settlement on the territory of <this city> was built by Celts before 1 AD. It was later occupied by the Romans. The Roman settlement \u2013 Aquincum \u2013 became the main city of Pannonia Inferior in 106 AD. At first it was a military settlement, and gradually the city rose around it, making it the focal point of the city's commercial life. Today this area corresponds to the \u00d3buda district within <this city>. The Romans constructed roads, amphitheaters, baths and houses with heated floors in this fortified military camp. The Roman city of Aquincum is the best-conserved of the Roman sites in <this country>. The archaeological site was turned into a museum with indoor and open-air sections.The Magyar tribes led by \u00c1rp\u00e1d, forced out of their original homeland north of Bulgaria by Tsar Simeon after the Battle of Southern Buh, settled in the territory at the end of the 9th century displacing the founding Bulgarian settlers of the towns of Buda and Pest, and a century later officially founded the Kingdom of <this country>. Research places the probable residence of the \u00c1rp\u00e1ds as an early place of central power near what became <this city>. The Tatar invasion in the 13th century quickly proved it is difficult to defend a plain. King B\u00e9la IV of <this country>, therefore, ordered the construction of reinforced stone walls around the towns and set his own royal palace on the top of the protecting hills of Buda. In 1361 it became the capital of <this country>.The cultural role of Buda was particularly significant during the reign of King Matthias Corvinus. The Italian Renaissance had a great influence on the city. His library, the Bibliotheca Corviniana, was Europe's greatest collection of historical chronicles and philosophic and scientific works in the 15th century, and second in size only to the Vatican Library. After the foundation of the first Hungarian university in P\u00e9cs in 1367 (University of P\u00e9cs), the second one was established in \u00d3buda in 1395 (University of \u00d3buda). The first Hungarian book was printed in Buda in 1473. Buda had about 5,000 inhabitants around the year 1500.\nThe Ottomans conquered Buda in 1526, as well in 1529, and finally occupied it in 1541. The Turkish Rule lasted for more than 150 years. The Ottoman Turks constructed many prominent bathing facilities within the city. Some of the baths that the Turks erected during their rule are still in use 500 years later (Rudas Baths and Kir\u00e1ly Baths). By 1547 the number of Christians was down to about a thousand, and by 1647 it had fallen to only about seventy. The unoccupied western part of the country became part of the Habsburg monarchy as Royal <this country>.\nIn 1686, two years after the unsuccessful siege of Buda, a renewed campaign was started to enter Buda. This time, the Holy League's army was twice as large, containing over 74,000 men, including German, Croat, Dutch, Hungarian, English, Spanish, Czech, Italian, French, Burgundian, Danish and Swedish soldiers, along with other Europeans as volunteers, artillerymen, and officers. The Christian forces seized Buda, and in the next few years, all of the former Hungarian lands, except areas near Temesv\u00e1r (Timi\u0219oara), were taken from the Turks. In the 1699 Treaty of Karlowitz, these territorial changes were officially recognized as the end of the rule of the Turks, and in 1718 the entire Kingdom of <this country> was removed from Ottoman rule.\n\nContemporary history after Unification\nThe 19th century was dominated by the Hungarian struggle for independence and modernisation. The national insurrection against the Habsburgs began in the Hungarian capital in 1848 and was defeated one and a half years later, with the help of the Russian Empire. 1867 was the year of Reconciliation that brought about the birth of Austria-<this country>. This made <this city> the twin capital of a dual monarchy. It was this compromise which opened the second great phase of development in the history of <this city>, lasting until World War I. In 1849 the Chain Bridge linking Buda with Pest was opened as the first permanent bridge across the Danube and in 1873 Buda and Pest were officially merged with the third part, \u00d3buda (Old Buda), thus creating the new metropolis of <this city>. The dynamic Pest grew into the country's administrative, political, economic, trade and cultural hub. Ethnic Hungarians overtook Germans in the second half of the 19th century due to mass migration from the overpopulated rural Transdanubia and Great Hungarian Plain. Between 1851 and 1910 the proportion of Hungarians increased from 35.6% to 85.9%, Hungarian became the dominant language, and German was crowded out. The proportion of Jews peaked in 1900 with 23.6%. Due to the prosperity and the large Jewish community of the city at the start of the 20th century, <this city> was often called the \"Jewish Mecca\" or \"Judapest\". <this city> also became an important center for the Aromanian diaspora during the 19th century. In 1918, Austria-<this country> lost the war and collapsed; <this country> declared itself an independent republic (Republic of <this country>). In 1920 the Treaty of Trianon partitioned the country, and as a result, <this country> lost over two-thirds of its territory, and about two-thirds of its inhabitants, including 3.3 million out of 15 million ethnic Hungarians.\nIn 1944, a year before the end of World War II, <this city> was partly destroyed by British and American air raids (first attack 4 April 1944).\nFrom 24 December 1944 to 13 February 1945, the city was besieged during the Battle of <this city>. <this city> sustained major damage caused by the attacking Soviet and Romanian troops and the defending German and Hungarian troops. More than 38,000 civilians died during the conflict. All bridges were destroyed by the Germans. The stone lions that have decorated the Chain Bridge since 1852 survived the devastation of the war.Between 20% and 40% of Greater <this city>'s 250,000 Jewish inhabitants died through Nazi and Arrow Cross Party, during the German occupation of <this country>, from 1944 to early 1945.Swiss diplomat Carl Lutz rescued tens of thousands of Jews by issuing Swiss protection papers and designating numerous buildings, including the now famous Glass House (\u00dcvegh\u00e1z) at Vad\u00e1sz Street 29, to be Swiss protected territory. About 3,000 Hungarian Jews found refuge at the Glass House and in a neighboring building. Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg saved the lives of tens of thousands of Jews in <this city> by giving them Swedish protection papers and taking them under his consular protection. Wallenberg was abducted by the Russians on 17 January 1945 and never regained freedom. Giorgio Perlasca, an Italian citizen, saved thousands of Hungarian Jews posing as a Spanish diplomat. Some other diplomats also abandoned diplomatic protocol and rescued Jews. There are two monuments for Wallenberg, one for Carl Lutz and one for Giorgio Perlasca in <this city>.\nFollowing the capture of <this country> from Nazi Germany by the Red Army, Soviet military occupation ensued, which ended only in 1991. The Soviets exerted significant influence on Hungarian political affairs. In 1949, <this country> was declared a communist People's Republic (People's Republic of <this country>). The new Communist government considered the buildings like the Buda Castle symbols of the former regime, and during the 1950s the palace was gutted and all the interiors were destroyed (also see Stalin era).\nOn 23 October 1956 citizens held a large peaceful demonstration in <this city> demanding democratic reform. The demonstrators went to the <this city> radio station and demanded to publish their demands. The regime ordered troops to shoot into the crowd. Hungarian soldiers gave rifles to the demonstrators who were now able to capture the building. This initiated the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. The demonstrators demanded to appoint Imre Nagy to be Prime Minister of <this country>. To their surprise, the central committee of the \"Hungarian Working People's Party\" did so that same evening. This uprising was an anti-Soviet revolt that lasted from 23 October until 11 November. After Nagy had declared that <this country> was to leave the Warsaw Pact and become neutral, Soviet tanks and troops entered the country to crush the revolt. Fighting continued until mid November, leaving more than 3000 dead. A monument was erected at the fiftieth anniversary of the revolt in 2006, at the edge of the City Park. Its shape is a wedge with a 56 angle degree made in rusted iron that gradually becomes shiny, ending in an intersection to symbolize Hungarian forces that temporarily eradicated the Communist leadership.From the 1960s to the late 1980s <this country> was often satirically referred to as \"the happiest barrack\" within the Eastern bloc, and much of the wartime damage to the city was finally repaired. Work on Erzs\u00e9bet Bridge, the last to be rebuilt, was finished in 1964. In the early 1970s, <this city> Metro's east\u2013west M2 line was first opened, followed by the M3 line in 1976. In 1987, Buda Castle and the banks of the Danube were included in the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites. Andr\u00e1ssy Avenue (including the Millennium Underground Railway, H\u0151s\u00f6k tere, and V\u00e1rosliget) was added to the UNESCO list in 2002. In the 1980s, the city's population reached 2.1 million. In recent times a significant decrease in population occurred mainly due to a massive movement to the neighbouring agglomeration in Pest county, i.e., suburbanisation.In the last decades of the 20th century the political changes of 1989\u201390 (Fall of the Iron Curtain) concealed changes in civil society and along the streets of <this city>. The monuments of the dictatorship were removed from public places, into Memento Park. In the first 20 years of the new democracy, the development of the city was managed by its mayor, G\u00e1bor Demszky.\n\nGeography\nTopography\n<this city>, strategically placed at the centre of the Carpathian Basin, lies on an ancient route linking the hills of Transdanubia with the Great Plain.  By road it is 216 kilometres (134 mi) south-east of Vienna, 545 kilometres (339 mi) south of Warsaw, 1,565 kilometres (972 mi) south-west of Moscow, 1,122 kilometres (697 mi) north of Athens, 788 kilometres (490 mi) north-east of Milan, and 443 kilometres (275 mi) south-east of Prague.The 525 square kilometres (203 sq mi) area of <this city> lies in Central <this country>, surrounded by settlements of the agglomeration in Pest county. The capital extends 25 and 29 km (16 and 18 mi) in the north\u2013south, east\u2013west direction respectively. The Danube enters the city from the north; later it encircles two islands, \u00d3buda Island and Margaret Island. The third island Csepel Island is the largest of the <this city> Danube islands, however only its northernmost tip is within city limits. The river that separates the two parts of the city is 230 m (755 ft) wide at its narrowest point in <this city>. Pest lies on the flat terrain of the Great Plain while Buda is rather hilly.The wide Danube was always fordable at this point because of a small number of islands in the middle of the river. The city has marked topographical contrasts: Buda is built on the higher river terraces and hills of the western side, while the considerably larger Pest spreads out on a flat and featureless sand plain on the river's opposite bank. Pest's terrain rises with a slight eastward gradient, so the easternmost parts of the city lie at the same altitude as Buda's smallest hills, notably Gell\u00e9rt Hill and Castle Hill.The Buda hills consist mainly of limestone and dolomite, the water created speleothems, the most famous ones being the P\u00e1lv\u00f6lgyi cave (total length 7,200 m or 23,600 ft) and the Szeml\u0151hegyi cave (total length 2,200 m or 7,200 ft). The hills were formed in the Triassic Period. The highest point of the hills and of <this city> is J\u00e1nos Hill, at 527 metres (1,729 feet) above sea level. The lowest point is the line of the Danube which is 96 metres (315 feet) above sea level.  <this city> is also rich in green areas. Of the 525 square kilometres (203 square miles) occupied by the city, 83 square kilometres (32 square miles) is green area, park and forest. The forests of Buda hills are environmentally protected.The city's importance in terms of traffic is very central, because many major European roads and European railway lines lead to <this city>. The Danube was and is still an important water-way and this region in the centre of the Carpathian Basin lies at the cross-roads of trade routes.\n<this city> is one of only three capital cities in the world which has thermal springs (the others being Reykjav\u00edk in Iceland and Sofia in Bulgaria). Some 125 springs produce 70 million litres (15,000,000 imperial gallons; 18,000,000 US gallons) of thermal water a day, with temperatures ranging up to 58 Celsius. Some of these waters have been claimed to have medicinal effects due to their high mineral contents.\n\nClimate\n<this city> has a humid subtropical climate. Winter (November until early March) can be cold and the city receives little sunshine. Snowfall is fairly frequent in most years, and nighttime temperatures of \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) are not uncommon between mid-December and mid-February. The spring months (March and April) see variable conditions, with a rapid increase in the average temperature. The weather in late March and in April is often very agreeable during the day and fresh at night. <this city>'s long summer \u2013 lasting from May until mid-September \u2013 is warm or very warm. Sudden heavy showers also occur, particularly in May and June. The autumn in <this city> (mid-September until late October) is characterised by little rain and long sunny days with moderate temperatures. Temperatures often turn abruptly colder in late October or early November.\nMean annual precipitation in <this city> is around 23.5 inches (596.9 mm). On average, there are 84 days with precipitation and 1988 hours of sunshine (of a possible 4383) each year. From March to October, average sunshine totals are roughly equal to those seen in northern Italy (Venice).\nThe city lies on the boundary between Zone 6 and Zone 7 in terms of the hardiness zone.\n\nArchitecture\n<this city> has architecturally noteworthy buildings in a wide range of styles and from distinct time periods, from the ancient times as Roman City of Aquincum in \u00d3buda (District III), which dates to around 89 AD, to the most modern Palace of Arts, the contemporary arts museum and concert hall.Most buildings in <this city> are relatively low: in the early 2010s there were around 100 buildings higher than 45 metres (148 ft). The number of high-rise buildings is kept low by building legislation, which is aimed at preserving the historic cityscape and to meet the requirements of the World Heritage Site. Strong rules apply to the planning, authorisation and construction of high-rise buildings and consequently much of the inner city does not have any. Some planners would like see an easing of the rules for the construction of skyscrapers, and the possibility of building skyscrapers outside the city's historic core has been raised.In the chronological order of architectural styles <this city> is represented on the entire timeline, starting with the Roman City of Aquincum representing ancient architecture.\nThe next determinative style is the Gothic architecture in <this city>. The few remaining Gothic buildings can be found in the Castle District. Buildings of note are no. 18, 20 and 22 on Orsz\u00e1gh\u00e1z Street, which date back to the 14th century and No. 31 \u00dari Street, which has a Gothic fa\u00e7ade that dates back to the 15th century. Other buildings with Gothic features are the Inner City Parish Church, built in the 12th century, and the Mary Magdalene Church, completed in the 15th century. The most characteristic Gothic-style buildings are actually Neo-Gothic, like the most well-known <this city> landmarks, the Hungarian Parliament Building and the Matthias Church, where much of the original material was used (originally built in Romanesque style in 1015).The next chapter in the history of human architecture is Renaissance architecture. One of the earliest places to be influenced by the Renaissance style of architecture was <this country>, and <this city> in particular. The style appeared following the marriage of King Matthias Corvinus and Beatrice of Naples in 1476. Many Italian artists, craftsmen and masons came to Buda with the new queen. Today, many of the original renaissance buildings disappeared during the varied history of Buda, but <this city> is still rich in renaissance and neo-renaissance buildings, like the famous Hungarian State Opera House, St. Stephen's Basilica and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.During the Turkish occupation (1541\u20131686), Islamic culture flourished in <this city>; multiple mosques and baths were built in the city. These were great examples of Ottoman architecture, which was influenced by Muslims from around the world including Turkish, Iranian, Arabian and to a larger extent, Byzantine architecture as well as Islamic traditions. After the Holy League conquered <this city>, they replaced most of the mosques with churches and minarets were turned into bell towers and cathedral spires. At one point the distinct sloping central square in <this city> became a bustling Oriental bazaar, which was filled with \"the chatter of camel caravans on their way to Yemen and India\". <this city> is in fact one of the few places in the world with functioning original Turkish bathhouses dating back to the 16th century, like Rudas Baths or Kir\u00e1ly Baths. <this city> is home to the northernmost place where the tomb of influential Islamic Turkish Sufi Dervish, G\u00fcl Baba is found. Various cultures converged in <this country> seemed to coalesce well with each other, as if all these different cultures and architecture styles are digested into <this country>'s own way of cultural blend. A precedent to show the city's self-conscious is the top section of the city's main square, named as Szechenyi. When Turks came to the city, they built mosques here which was aggressively replaced with Gothic church of St. Bertalan. The rationale of reusing the base of the former Islamic building mosque and reconstruction into Gothic Church but Islamic style architecture over it is typically Islamic are still visible. An official term for the rationale is spolia. The mosque was called the djami of Pasha Gazi Kassim, and djami means mosque in Arabic. After Turks and Muslims were expelled and massacred from <this city>, the site was reoccupied by Christians and reformed into a church, the Inner City Parish Church (<this city>). The minaret and Turkish entranceway were removed. The shape of the architecture is its only hint of exotic past\u2014\"two surviving prayer niches facing Mecca and an ecumenical symbol atop its cupola: a cross rising above the Turkish crescent moon\".\nAfter 1686, the Baroque architecture designated the dominant style of art in catholic countries from the 17th century to the 18th century. There are many Baroque-style buildings in <this city> and one of the finest examples of preserved Baroque-style architecture is the Church of St. Anna in Batthyh\u00e1ny square. An interesting part of <this city> is the less touristy \u00d3buda, the main square of which also has some beautiful preserved historic buildings with Baroque fa\u00e7ades. The Castle District is another place to visit where the best-known landmark Buda Royal Palace and many other buildings were built in the Baroque style.The Classical architecture and Neoclassical architecture are the next in the timeline. <this city> had not one but two architects that were masters of the Classicist style. Mih\u00e1ly Pollack (1773\u20131855) and J\u00f3zsef Hild (1789\u20131867), built many beautiful Classicist-style buildings in the city. Some of the best examples are the Hungarian National Museum, the Lutheran Church of Budav\u00e1r (both designed by Pollack) and the seat of the Hungarian president, the S\u00e1ndor Palace. The most iconic and widely known Classicist-style attraction in <this city> is the Sz\u00e9chenyi Chain Bridge. <this city>'s two most beautiful Romantic architecture buildings are the Great Synagogue in Doh\u00e1ny Street and the Vigad\u00f3 Concert Hall on the Danube Promenade, both designed by architect Frigyes Feszl (1821\u20131884). Another noteworthy structure is the <this city> Western Railway Station, which was designed by August de Serres and built by the Eiffel Company of Paris in 1877.\nArt Nouveau came into fashion in <this city> by the exhibitions which were held in and around 1896 and organised in connection with the Hungarian Millennium celebrations. Art Nouveau in <this country> (Szecesszi\u00f3 in Hungarian) is a blend of several architectural styles, with a focus on <this country>'s specialities. One of the leading Art Nouveau architects, \u00d6d\u00f6n Lechner (1845\u20131914), was inspired by Indian and Syrian architecture as well as traditional Hungarian decorative designs. One of his most beautiful buildings in <this city> is the Museum of Applied Arts. Another examples for Art Nouveau in <this city> is the Gresham Palace in front of the Chain Bridge, the Hotel Gell\u00e9rt, the Franz Liszt Academy of Music or <this city> Zoo and Botanical Garden.\n\nThe second half of the 20th century also saw, under the communist regime, the construction of blocks of flats (panelh\u00e1z), as in other Eastern European countries. In the 21st century, <this city> faces new challenges in its architecture. The pressure towards the high-rise buildings is unequivocal among today's world cities, but preserving <this city>'s unique cityscape and its very diverse architecture, along with green areas, is force <this city> to balance between them. The Contemporary architecture has wide margin in the city. Public spaces attract heavy investment by business and government also, so that the city has gained entirely new (or renovated and redesigned) squares, parks and monuments, for example the city central Kossuth Lajos square, De\u00e1k Ferenc square and Liberty Square. Numerous landmarks are created in the last decade in <this city>, like the National Theatre, Palace of Arts, R\u00e1k\u00f3czi Bridge, Megyeri Bridge, <this city> Airport Sky Court among others, and millions of square meters of new office buildings and apartments. But there are still large opportunities in real estate development in the city.\n\nDistricts\nMost of today's <this city> is the result of a late-nineteenth-century renovation, but the wide boulevards laid out then only bordered and bisected much older quarters of activity created by centuries of <this city>'s evolution as a city. <this city>'s vast urban area is often described using a set of district names. These are either informal designations, reflecting the names of villages that have been absorbed by sprawl, or are superseded administrative units of former boroughs. Such names have remained in use through tradition, each referring to a local area with its own distinctive character, but without official boundaries. Originally <this city> had 10 districts after coming into existence upon the unification of the three cities in 1873. Since 1950, Greater <this city> has been divided into 22 boroughs (and 23 since 1994). At that time there were changes both in the order of districts and in their sizes. The city now consists of 23 districts, 6 in Buda, 16 in Pest and 1 on Csepel Island between them. The city centre itself, in its broadest sense, comprises Districts V, VI, VII, VIII, IX and XIII on the Pest side, and I, II, XI and XII on the Buda side of the city.District I is a small area in central Buda, including the historic Buda Castle. District II is also in Buda, in the northwest, and District III stretches along the northernmost part of Buda. To reach District IV, one must cross the Danube to Pest (the eastern side), where it occupies the northernmost point. With District V, another circle begins, located right in the absolute centre of Pest. Districts VI, VII, VIII and IX are the neighbouring areas to the east, going southwards, one after the other. District X is another, more external circle, also in Pest, while one must jump to the Buda side again to find Districts XI and XII, going northwards. No other districts in this circle remain in Buda. We must retrace our steps to Pest again to find Districts XIII, XIV, XV, XVI, XVII, XVIII, XIX and XX (mostly external parts of the city ), lying almost regularly in a semicircle, going southwards again. District XXI is the extension of the above circle between two branches of the Danube, the northern tip of a long island south of <this city>.

During the day the island is occupied by people doing sports, or just resting. In the summer (generally on the weekends) mostly young people go to the island at night to party on its terraces, or to recreate with a bottle of alcohol on a bench or on the grass (this form of entertainment is sometimes referred to as bench-partying).\nCsepel Island (Hungarian: Csepel-sziget [\u02c8t\u0361\u0283\u025bp\u025blsi\u0261\u025bt]) is the largest island of the River Danube in <this country>. It is 48 km (30 mi) long; its width is 6 to 8 km (4 to 5 mi) and its area comprises 257 km2 (99 sq mi). However, only the northern tip of the island is inside the city limits.\nHaj\u00f3gy\u00e1ri Island (Hungarian: Haj\u00f3gy\u00e1ri-sziget [\u02c8h\u0252jo\u02d0\u025fa\u02d0risi\u0261\u025bt]), also known as \u00d3buda Island (Hungarian: \u00d3budai-sziget), is a human-made island located in the third district.

This is the island where the famous Sziget Festival takes place, hosting hundreds of performances per year. Around 400,000 visitors attended the last festival. Many building projects are taking place to make this island into one of the biggest entertainment centres of Europe. The plan is to build apartment buildings, hotels, casinos and a marina.\nMoln\u00e1r Island (Hungarian: Moln\u00e1r-sziget) is an island in the channel of the Danube that separates Csepel Island from the east bank of the river.The islands of Palotai Island, N\u00e9p Island, and H\u00e1ros Island also formerly existed within the city, but have been joined to the mainland.\nThe \u00cdns\u00e9g Rock (Hungarian: \u00cdns\u00e9g-szikla) is a reef in the Danube close to the shore under the Gell\u00e9rt Hill. It is only exposed during drought periods when the river level is very low.\nJust outside the city boundary to the north lies the large Szentendre Island (Hungarian: Szentendrei-sziget) and the much smaller Lupa Island (Hungarian: Lupa-sziget).\n\nSpas\nOne of the reasons the Romans first colonised the area immediately to the west of the River Danube and established their regional capital at Aquincum (now part of \u00d3buda, in northern <this city>) is so that they could use and enjoy the thermal springs. There are still ruins visible today of the enormous baths that were built during that period. The new baths that were constructed during the Turkish period (1541\u20131686) served both bathing and medicinal purposes, and some of these are still in use to this day.<this city> gained its reputation as a city of spas in the 1920s, following the first realisation of the economic potential of the thermal waters in drawing in visitors. Indeed, in 1934 <this city> was officially ranked as a \"City of Spas\". Today, the baths are mostly frequented by the older generation, as, with the exception of the \"Magic Bath\" and \"Cinetrip\" water discos, young people tend to prefer the lidos which are open in the summer.\nConstruction of the Kir\u00e1ly Baths started in 1565, and most of the present-day building dates from the Turkish period, including most notably the fine cupola-topped pool.\nThe Rudas Baths are centrally placed \u2013 in the narrow strip of land between Gell\u00e9rt Hill and the River Danube \u2013 and also an outstanding example of architecture dating from the Turkish period. The central feature is an octagonal pool over which light shines from a 10 metres (33 ft) diameter cupola, supported by eight pillars.\nThe Gell\u00e9rt Baths and Hotel were built in 1918, although there had once been Turkish baths on the site, and in the Middle Ages a hospital. In 1927, the Baths were extended to include the wave pool, and the effervescent bath was added in 1934. The well-preserved Art Nouveau interior includes colourful mosaics, marble columns, stained glass windows and statues.\nThe Luk\u00e1cs Baths are also in Buda and are also Turkish in origin, although they were only revived at the end of the 19th century. This was also when the spa and treatment centre were founded. There is still something of an atmosphere of fin-de-si\u00e8cle about the place, and all around the inner courtyard there are marble tablets recalling the thanks of patrons who were cured there. Since the 1950s it has been regarded as a centre for intellectuals and artists.\nThe Sz\u00e9chenyi Baths are one of the largest bathing complexes in all Europe, and the only \"old\" medicinal baths to be found in the Pest side of the city. The indoor medicinal baths date from 1913 and the outdoor pools from 1927. There is an atmosphere of grandeur about the whole place with the bright, largest pools resembling aspects associated with Roman baths, the smaller bath tubs reminding one of the bathing culture of the Greeks, and the saunas and diving pools borrowed from traditions emanating in northern Europe. The three outdoor pools (one of which is a fun pool) are open all year, including winter. Indoors there are over ten separate pools, and a whole host of medical treatments is also available.
