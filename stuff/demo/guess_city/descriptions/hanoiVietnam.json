  "wiki_text": "<this city> (<this country>ese: H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i, lit.\u2009'Inside of the rivers' [ha\u02d0\u02e8\u02e9 noj\u02e7\u02e8\u0294] (listen)) is the capital and second-most populous city of <this country>. It covers an area of 3,359.82 km2 (1,297.2 sq mi). It consists of 12 urban districts, one district-leveled town and 17 rural districts. It is located within the Red River Delta of Northern <this country>.\n<this city>'s history goes back to the third century BCE, when a portion of the modern-day city served as the capital of the historic <this country>ese nation of \u00c2u L\u1ea1c. Following the collapse of \u00c2u L\u1ea1c, the city was part of Han China. In 1010, <this country>ese emperor L\u00fd Th\u00e1i T\u1ed5 established the capital of the imperial <this country>ese nation \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t in modern-day central <this city>, naming the city Th\u0103ng Long (literally 'Ascending Dragon'). Th\u0103ng Long remained \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t's political centre until 1802, when the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty, the last imperial <this country>ese dynasty, moved the capital to Hu\u1ebf. The city was renamed <this city> in 1831, and served as the capital of French Indochina from 1902 to 1945. On 6 January 1946, the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of <this country> designated <this city> as the capital of the newly independent country, which would last during the First Indochina War (1946\u20131954) and the <this country> War (1955\u20131975). <this city> has been the capital of the Socialist Republic of <this country> since 1976.\nA major tourist destination in <this country>, <this city> offers well-preserved French colonial architecture, religious sites dedicated to Buddhism, Catholicism, Confucianism and Taoism, several historical landmarks of <this country>ese imperial periods, and a large number of museums. The Central Sector of the Imperial Citadel of Th\u0103ng Long in Ba Dinh District was recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2010.\n<this city> has a high Human Development Index of 0.799, ranking first amongst all the municipalities and provinces of <this country>. The city hosts various venerable educational institutions and cultural venues of significance, including the <this country> National University, the M\u1ef9 \u0110\u00ecnh National Stadium, and the <this country> National Museum of Fine Arts. <this city> was the only Asia-Pacific locality to be granted the \"City for Peace\" title by the UNESCO on 16 July 1999, recognizing its contributions to the struggle for peace, its efforts to promote equality in the community, protect the environment, promote culture and education, and care for younger generations. <this city> joined UNESCO's Network of Creative Cities as a Design City on 31 October 2019, on the occasion of World Cities' Day. The city has also hosted numerous political and international events, including APEC <this country> 2006, 132nd Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU-132), 2019 North Korea\u2013United States <this city> Summit, as well as 2009 Asian Indoor Games, and the Southeast Asian Games in 2003 and 2021.\n\nNames\n<this city> has had various names throughout history.\n\nIt was known first as Long Bi\u00ean (\u9f8d\u908a, \"dragon edge\"), then T\u1ed1ng B\u00ecnh (\u5b8b\u5e73, \"Song peace\") and Long \u0110\u1ed7 (\u9f8d\u809a, \"dragon belly\"). Long Bi\u00ean later gave its name to the famed Long Bi\u00ean Bridge, built during French colonial times, and more recently to a new district to the east of the Red River. Several older names of <this city> feature long (\u9f8d, \"dragon\"), linked to the curved formation of the Red River around the city, which was symbolized as a dragon.\nIn 866, it was turned into a citadel and named \u0110\u1ea1i La (\u5927\u7f85, \"big net\"). This gave it the nickname La Th\u00e0nh (\u7f85\u57ce, \"net citadel\"). Both \u0110\u1ea1i La and La Th\u00e0nh are names of major streets in modern <this city>.\nWhen L\u00fd Th\u00e1i T\u1ed5 established the capital in the area in 1010, it was named Th\u0103ng Long (\u6607\u9f8d, \"rising dragon\"). Th\u0103ng Long later became the name of a major bridge on the highway linking the city center to N\u1ed9i B\u00e0i Airport, and the Th\u0103ng Long Boulevard expressway in the southwest of the city center. In modern time, the city is usually referred to as Th\u0103ng Long \u2013 H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i, when its long history is discussed.\nDuring the H\u1ed3 dynasty, it was called \u0110\u00f4ng \u0110\u00f4 (\u6771\u90fd, \"eastern metropolis\").\nDuring the Ming occupation, it was called \u0110\u00f4ng Quan (\u6771\u95dc, \"eastern gate\").\nDuring the L\u00ea dynasty, <this city> was known as \u0110\u00f4ng Kinh (\u6771\u4eac, \"eastern capital\"). This gave the name to Tonkin and Gulf of Tonkin. A square adjacent to the Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm lake was named \u0110\u00f4ng Kinh Ngh\u0129a Th\u1ee5c after the reformist Tonkin Free School under French colonization.\nAfter the end of the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n had expanded further south, the city was named B\u1eafc Th\u00e0nh (\u5317\u57ce, \"northern citadel\").\nMinh M\u1ea1ng renamed the city H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i (\u6cb3\u5167, \"inside the rivers\") in 1831. This has remained its official name until modern times.\nSeveral unofficial names of <this city> include: K\u1ebb Ch\u1ee3 (marketplace), Tr\u00e0ng An (long peace), Ph\u01b0\u1ee3ng Th\u00e0nh/Ph\u1ee5ng Th\u00e0nh (phoenix city), Long Th\u00e0nh (short for Kinh th\u00e0nh Th\u0103ng Long, \"citadel of Th\u0103ng Long\"), Kinh k\u1ef3 (capital city), H\u00e0 Th\u00e0nh (short for Th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1 H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i, \"city of <this city>\"), Ho\u00e0ng Di\u1ec7u, and Th\u1ee7 \u0110\u00f4 (capital).\n\nHistory\nPre-Th\u0103ng Long period\nMany vestiges of human habitation from the late Palaeolithic and early Mesolithic ages can be found in <this city>. Between 1971 and 1972, archaeologists in Ba V\u00ec and \u0110\u00f4ng Anh discovered pebbles with traces of carving and processing by human hands that are relics of S\u01a1n Vi Culture, dating from 10,000 to 20,000 years ago. In 1998\u20131999, the Museum of <this country>ese History (now National Museum of <this country>ese History) carried out the archaeological studies in the north of Dong Mo Lake (Son Tay, <this city>), finding various relics and objects belonging to S\u01a1n Vi Culture \u2013 in the Paleolithic Age, 20,000 years ago. During the mid-Holocene transgression, the sea level rose and immersed low-lying areas; geological data clearly show the coastline was inundated and was located near present-day <this city>, as is apparent from the absence of Neolithic sites across most of the Bac Bo region. Consequently, from about 10,000 to approximately 4,000 years ago, <this city> in general was completely absent. It is believed that the region has been continuously inhabited for the last 4,000 years.\n\nKingdom of \u00c2u L\u1ea1c and Nanyue\nIn around third century BCE, An D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u01b0\u01a1ng established the capital of \u00c2u L\u1ea1c north of present-day <this city>, where a fortified citadel is constructed, known to history as C\u1ed5 Loa, the first political center of the <this country>ese civilization pre-Sinitic era, with an outer embankment covering 600 hectares. In 179 BC, the \u00c2u L\u1ea1c Kingdom was annexed by Nanyue, which ushered in more than a thousand years of Chinese domination. Zhao Tuo subsequently incorporated the regions into his Nanyue domain, but left the indigenous chiefs in control of the population. For the first time, the region formed part of a polity headed by a Chinese ruler.\n\n<this city> under Chinese rule\nIn 111 BC, the Han dynasty conquered Nanyue and ruled it for the next several hundred years. Han dynasty organized Nanyue into seven commanderies of the south (Lingnan) and now included three in <this country> alone: Giao Ch\u1ec9 and C\u1eedu Ch\u00e2n, and a newly established Nh\u1eadt Nam.In March of 40 AD, Tr\u01b0ng Tr\u1eafc and Tr\u01b0ng Nh\u1ecb, daughters of a wealthy aristocratic family of Lac ethnicity in M\u00ea Linh district (<this city>), led the locals to rise up in rebellion against the Han. It began at the Red River Delta, but quickly spread both south and north from Jiaozhi, stirring up all three L\u1ea1c Vi\u1ec7t regions and most of Lingnan, gaining the support of about 65 towns and settlements. Tr\u01b0ng sisters then established their court upriver in M\u00ea Linh. In 42 AD, the Han emperor commissioned general Ma Yuan to suppress the uprising with 32,000 men, including 20,000 regulars and 12,000 regional auxiliaries. The rebellion was defeated in the next year as Ma Yuan captured and decapitated Tr\u01b0ng Tr\u1eafc and Tr\u01b0ng Nh\u1ecb, then sent their heads to the Han court in Luoyang.By the middle of the fifth century, in the center of ancient <this city>, a fortified settlement was founded by the Chinese Liu Song dynasty as the seat of a new district called T\u1ed1ng B\u00ecnh (Songping) within Giao Ch\u1ec9 commandery. The name refers to its pacification by the dynasty. It was elevated to its own commandery at some point between AD 454 and 464.  The commandery included the districts of Yihuai (\u7fa9\u61f7) and Suining (\u7d8f\u5be7) in the south of the Red River (now T\u1eeb Li\u00eam and Ho\u00e0i \u0110\u1ee9c districts) with a metropolis (the domination centre) in the present inner <this city>.\n\nProtectorate of Annam\nBy the year 679, the Tang dynasty changed the region's name to Annan (Pacified South), with Songping as its capital.To defeat the people's uprisings in the later half of the eighth century, Zhang Boyi (\u5f35\u4f2f\u5100), a Tang dynasty viceroy, built Luocheng (\u7f85\u57ce, La Thanh or La citadel, from Thu Le to Quan Ngua in present-day Ba Dinh precinct). In the earlier half of the ninth century, it was further built up and called Jincheng (\u91d1\u57ce, Kim Thanh or Kim Citadel). In 863, Nanzhao army and local people laid siege of Jincheng and defeated the Chinese armies of 150,000. In 866, Chinese jiedushi Gao Pian recaptured the city and drove out the Nanzhao and rebels. He renamed the city to Daluocheng (\u5927\u7f85\u57ce, \u0110\u1ea1i La th\u00e0nh). He built the wall, 6,344 meters around the city, which some part were more than eight meters high. \u0110\u1ea1i La at the time with approximate 25,000 residents included small foreign communities and residents of Persians, Arabs, Indian, Cham, Javanese, and Nestorian Christians, became an important trading center of the Tang dynasty due to the ransacking of Guangzhou by Huang Chao rebellion. By early tenth century AD, modern-day <this city> was known to the Muslim traders as Luqin.\n\n<this city> under Independent <this country>\nTh\u0103ng Long, \u0110\u00f4ng \u0110\u00f4, \u0110\u00f4ng Quan, \u0110\u00f4ng Kinh\nIn 1010, L\u00fd Th\u00e1i T\u1ed5, the first ruler of the L\u00fd dynasty, moved the capital of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t to the site of the \u0110\u1ea1i La Citadel. Claiming to have seen a dragon ascending the Red River, he renamed the site Th\u0103ng Long (\u6607\u9f8d, \"Soaring Dragon\") \u2013 a name still used poetically to this day. Th\u0103ng Long remained the capital of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t until 1397, when it was moved to Thanh H\u00f3a, then known as T\u00e2y \u0110\u00f4 (\u897f\u90fd), the \"Western Capital\". Th\u0103ng Long then became \u0110\u00f4ng \u0110\u00f4 (\u6771\u90fd), the \"Eastern Capital\".\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIn 1408, the Chinese Ming dynasty attacked and occupied <this country>, changing \u0110\u00f4ng \u0110\u00f4's name to Dongguan (Chinese: \u6771\u95dc, Eastern Gateway), or \u0110\u00f4ng Quan in Sino-<this country>ese. In 1428, the <this country>ese overthrew the Chinese under the leadership of L\u00ea L\u1ee3i, who later founded the L\u00ea dynasty and renamed \u0110\u00f4ng Quan \u0110\u00f4ng Kinh (\u6771\u4eac, \"Eastern Capital\") or Tonkin. During 17th century, the population of \u0110\u00f4ng Kinh was estimated by Western diplomats as about 100,000. Right after the end of the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n dynasty, it was named B\u1eafc Th\u00e0nh (\u5317\u57ce, \"Northern Citadel\").\n\nDuring Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty and the French colonial period\nWhen the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty was established in 1802, Gia Long moved the capital to Hu\u1ebf. Th\u0103ng Long was no longer the capital, its H\u00e1n t\u1ef1 was changed from \u6607\u9f8d (\"Rising dragon\") to \u6607\u9686 (\"Ascent and prosperity\"), aiming to reduce the sentiment of L\u00ea dynasty. Emperors of <this country> usually used dragon (\u9f8d long) as a symbol of their imperial strength and power. In 1831, the Nguy\u1ec5n emperor Minh M\u1ea1ng renamed it H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i (\u6cb3\u5167, \"Between Rivers\" or \"River Interior\"). <this city> was occupied by the French in 1873 and passed to them ten years later. As Hano\u00ef, it was located in the protectorate of Tonkin and became the capital of French Indochina after 1887.\n\nDuring WWII and <this country> War\nThe city was occupied by the Imperial Japanese in 1940 and liberated in 1945, when it briefly became the seat of the Vi\u1ec7t Minh government after Ho Chi Minh proclaimed the independence of <this country>. However, the French returned and reoccupied the city in 1946. After nine years of fighting between the French and Viet Minh forces, <this city> became the capital of an independent North <this country> in 1954. The French Army withdrew that year and the People's Army of <this country> and International Control Commission occupied the city under the terms of the 1954 Geneva Conference.During the <this country> War, <this city>'s transportation facilities were disrupted by the bombing of bridges and railways by the U.S. Seventh Air Force and Republic of <this country> Air Force. These were all, however, later repaired. Following the end of the war, <this city> became the capital of a reunified <this country> when North and South <this country> were reunited on 2 July 1976.\n\nModern <this city>\nAfter the \u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi economic policies were approved in 1986, the Communist Party and national and municipal governments hoped to attract international investments for urban development projects in <this city>. The high-rise commercial buildings did not begin to appear until ten years later due to the international investment community being skeptical of the security of their investments in <this country>. Rapid urban development and rising costs displaced many residential areas in central <this city>. Following a short period of economic stagnation after the 1997 Asian financial crisis, <this city> resumed its rapid economic growth.On 29 May 2008, it was decided that H\u00e0 T\u00e2y Province, V\u0129nh Ph\u00fac Province's M\u00ea Linh District and four communes of L\u01b0\u01a1ng S\u01a1n District, H\u00f2a B\u00ecnh Province be merged into the metropolitan area of <this city> from 1 August 2008. <this city>'s total area then increased to 334,470 hectares in 29 subdivisions with the new population being 6,232,940., effectively tripling its size. The <this city> Capital Region (V\u00f9ng Th\u1ee7 \u0111\u00f4 H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i), a metropolitan area covering <this city> and six surrounding provinces under its administration, will have an area of 13,436 square kilometres (5,188 sq mi) with 15 million people by 2020.\n<this city> has experienced a rapid construction boom recently. Skyscrapers, appearing in new urban areas, have dramatically changed the cityscape and have formed a modern skyline outside the old city. In 2015, <this city> is ranked 39th by Emporis in the list of world cities with most skyscrapers over 100 m; its two tallest buildings are <this city> Landmark 72 Tower (336 m, second tallest in <this country> after Ho Chi Minh City's Landmark 81 and third tallest in south-east Asia after Malaysia's Petronas Towers) and <this city> Lotte Center (272 m, also, third tallest in <this country>).\nPublic outcry in opposition to the redevelopment of culturally significant areas in <this city> persuaded the national government to implement a low-rise policy surrounding Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm Lake. The Ba \u0110\u00ecnh District is also protected from commercial redevelopment.\n\nGeography\nLocation, topography\n<this city> is a landlocked municipality in the northern region of <this country>, situated in <this country>'s Red River delta, nearly 90 km (56 mi) from the coast. <this city> contains three basic kinds of terrain, which are the delta area, the midland area and the mountainous zone. In general, the terrain becomes gradually lower from north to south and from west to east, with the average height ranging from 5 to 20 meters above sea level. Hills and mountainous zones are located in the northern and western parts of the city. The highest peak is at Ba Vi with 1281 m, located west of the city proper.\n\nClimate\nWhen using the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, the ClimaTemps.com website ranks <this city> as a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwa) with plentiful precipitation like other places in Northern <this country>. The city experiences the typical climate of northern <this country>, with four distinct seasons. Summer, from May to September, is characterized by hot and humid weather with abundant rainfall, and few dry days.:\u200a40\u200a Hot, dry conditions caused by westerly winds during summer are rare.:\u200a40\u200a From October to November comprise the fall season, characterized by a decrease in temperature and precipitation, this time in the year mostly are warm and mild. Winters, from December to January, are characterized as being cool by the northeast monsoon, making <this city> have a dry winter and large amount of sunshine. Spring, from February until the end of April, <this city> is usually characterized with large amounts of drizzle and little sunshine due to the strong activity of the southeast monsoon blowing moisture from the sea inland.:\u200a40\u200a The city is usually cloudy and foggy in this time, averaging only 1.5 hours of sunshine per day in February and March. The city has times to be influenced by cold waves from the Northeast. <this city> is the only capital of Southeast Asia with a subtropical climate.\nThe region has a positive water balance (i.e. the precipitation exceeds the potential evapotranspiration). <this city> averages 1,612 millimetres (63.5 in) of rainfall per year, the majority falling from May to October. There are an average of 114 days with rain. The average annual temperature is 23.6 \u00b0C (74 \u00b0F), with a mean relative humidity of more than 80%.

The most recent snow happened on Ba V\u00ec mountain range, and the temperature fell to 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) on January 24, 2016.\n\nAdministrative divisions\nH\u00e0 N\u1ed9i is divided into 12 urban districts, 1 district-leveled town and 17 rural districts. When H\u00e0 T\u00e2y was merged into <this city> in 2008, H\u00e0 \u0110\u00f4ng was transformed into an urban district while S\u01a1n T\u00e2y is demoted to a district-level town. They are further subdivided into 22 commune-level towns (or townlets), 399 communes, and 145 wards.\nHT \u2013 formerly an administrative subdivision unit of the defunct H\u00e0 T\u00e2y Province.\n\nDemographics\nDuring the French colonial period, as the capital of French Indochina, <this city> attracted a considerable number of French, Chinese and <this country>ese from the surrounding areas. In the 1940s the population of the city was 132,145. After the First Indochina War, many French and Chinese people left the city to either move south or repatriate.\n<this city>'s population only started to increase rapidly in the second half 20th century. In 1954, the city had 53 thousand inhabitants, covering an area of 152 km2. By 1961, the area of the city had expanded to 584 km2, and the population was 91,000 people. In 1978, National Assembly (<this country>) decided to expand <this city> for the second time to 2,136 km2, with a population of 2.5 million people. By 1991, the area of <this city> continued to change, decreasing to 924 km2 (357 sq mi), but the population was still over 2 million people. During the 1990s, <this city>'s population increased steadily, reaching 2,672,122 people in 1999. After the most recent expansion in August 2008, <this city> has a population of 6.233 million and is among the 17 capitals with the largest area in the world. According to the 2009 census, <this city>'s population is 6,451,909 people. As of 1 April 2019, <this city> had a population of 8,053,663, including 3,991,919 males and 4,061,744 females.

It has over eight million residents within the city proper and an estimated population of 20 million within the metropolitan area.\nThe number of <this city>ans who have settled down for more than three generations is likely to be very small when compared to the overall population of the city. Even in the Old Quarter, where commerce started hundreds of years ago and consisted mostly of family businesses, many of the street-front stores nowadays are owned by merchants and retailers from other provinces. The original owner family may have either rented out the store and moved into the adjoining house or moved out of the neighborhood altogether. The pace of change has especially escalated after the abandonment of central-planning economic policies and relaxing of the district-based household registrar system.<this city>'s telephone numbers have been increased to 8 digits to cope with demand (October 2008). Subscribers' telephone numbers have been changed in a haphazard way; however, mobile phones and SIM cards are readily available in <this country>, with pre-paid mobile phone credit available in all areas of <this city>.\n\nReligion\nBuddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism are the main religions of <this city> for many years.

In the year 2013, <this city> contributed 12.6% to GDP, exported 7.5% of total exports, contributed 17% to the national budget and attracted 22% investment capital of <this country>. The city's nominal GDP at current prices reached 451,213 billion VND (US$21.48 billion) in 2013, which made per capita GDP stand at 63.3 million VND (US$3,000).\nIndustrial production in the city has experienced a rapid boom since the 1990s, with average annual growth of 19.1 percent from 1991 to 1995, 15.9 percent from 1996 to 2000, and 20.9 percent during 2001\u20132003.

In 2003, <this city> had 2,000 businesses engaged in foreign trade, having established ties with 161 countries and territories. The city's export value grew by an average 11.6 percent each year from 1996 to 2000 and 9.1 percent during 2001\u20132003. The economic structure also underwent important shifts, with tourism, finance, and banking now playing an increasingly important role. <this city>'s traditional business districts are Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm, Hai B\u00e0 Tr\u01b0ng and \u0110\u1ed1ng \u0110a; and newly developing C\u1ea7u Gi\u1ea5y, Nam T\u1eeb Li\u00eam, B\u1eafc T\u1eeb Li\u00eam, Thanh Xu\u00e2n and H\u00e0 \u0110\u00f4ng in the west.\nSimilar to Ho Chi Minh City, <this city> enjoys a rapidly developing real estate market. The most notable new urban areas are central Trung H\u00f2a Nh\u00e2n Ch\u00ednh, M\u1ef9 \u0110\u00ecnh, the luxurious zones of The Manor, Ciputra, Royal City in the Nguy\u1ec5n Tr\u00e3i Street (Thanh Xu\u00e2n District) and Times City in the Hai B\u00e0 Tr\u01b0ng District. With an estimated nominal GDP of US$42.04 billion as of 2019, it is the second most productive economic area of <this country> (after Ho Chi Minh City)\nAgriculture, previously a pillar in <this city>'s economy, has striven to reform itself, introducing new high-yield plant varieties and livestock, and applying modern farming techniques.After the economic reforms that initiated economic growth, <this city>'s appearance has also changed significantly, especially in recent years. Infrastructure is constantly being upgraded, with new roads and an improved public transportation system. <this city> has allowed many fast-food chains into the city, such as McDonald's, Lotteria, Pizza Hut, KFC, and others. Locals in <this city> perceive the ability to purchase \"fast-food\" as an indication of luxury and permanent fixtures. Similarly, city officials are motivated by food safety concerns and their aspirations for a \"modern\" city to replace the 67 traditional food markets with 1,000 supermarkets by 2025. This is likely to increase consumption of less nutritious foods, as traditional markets are key for consumption of fresh rather than processed foods.Over three-quarters of the jobs in <this city> are state-owned. 9% of jobs are provided by collectively owned organizations. 13.3% of jobs are in the private sector. The structure of employment has been changing rapidly as state-owned institutions downsize and private enterprises grow. <this city> has in-migration controls which allow the city to accept only people who add skills <this city>'s economy. A 2006 census found that 5,600 rural produce vendors exist in <this city>, with 90% of them coming from surrounding rural areas. These numbers indicate the much greater earning potential in urban rather than in rural spaces. The uneducated, rural, and mostly female street vendors are depicted as participants of \"microbusiness\" and local grassroots economic development by business reports. In July 2008, <this city>'s city government devised a policy to partially ban street vendors and side-walk based commerce on 62 streets due to concerns about public health and \"modernizing\" the city's image to attract foreigners. Many foreigners believe that the vendors add a traditional and nostalgic aura to the city, although street vending was much less common prior to the 1986 \u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi policies. The vendors have not able to form effective resistance tactics to the ban and remain embedded in the dominant capitalist framework of modern <this city>.<this city> is part of the Maritime Silk Road that runs from the Chinese coast through the Strait of Malacca towards the southern tip of India to Mombasa, from there through the Red Sea via the Suez Canal to the Mediterranean, there to the Upper Adriatic region to the northern Italian hub of Trieste with its rail connections to Central Europe and the North Sea.\n\nDevelopment\nInfrastructural development\nA development master plan for <this city> was designed by Ernest Hebrard in 1924, but was only partially implemented. The previous close relationship between the Soviet Union and <this country> led to the creation of the first comprehensive plan for <this city> with the assistance of Soviet planners between 1981 and 1984. It was never realized because it appeared to be incompatible with <this city>'s existing layout.In recent years, two master plans have been created to guide <this city>'s development. The first was the <this city> Master Plan 1990\u20132010, approved in April 1992. It was created out of collaboration between planners from <this city> and the National Institute of Urban and Rural Planning in the Ministry of Construction. The plan's three main objectives were to create housing and a new commercial center in an area known as Ngh\u0129a \u0110\u00f4, expand residential and industrial areas in the Gia L\u00e2m District, and develop the three southern corridors linking <this city> to H\u00e0 \u0110\u00f4ng and the Thanh Tr\u00ec District. The result of the land-use pattern was meant to resemble a five cornered star by 2010. In 1998, a revised version of the <this city> Master plan was approved to be completed in 2020. It addressed the significant increase of population projections within <this city>. Population densities and high rise buildings in the inner city were planned to be limited to protect the old parts of inner <this city>. A rail transport system is planned to be built to expand public transport and link the <this city> to surrounding areas. Projects such as airport upgrading, a golf course, and cultural villages have been approved for development by the government.<this city> is still faced with the problems associated with increasing urbanization. Although it is a major transport hub with a large network of national routes, expressways, railways, and is home to Noi Bai International Airport, the busiest airport in <this country>, the disparity of wealth between the rich and the poor is a problem in both the capital and throughout the country. <this city>'s public infrastructure was assessed as in poor condition with high amounts of pollution and congestion in 2001. The city also has air and water pollution, difficult road conditions, traffic congestion, and a rudimentary public transit system. Traffic congestion and air pollution are worsening as the number of motor cycles increases. Squatter settlements are expanding on the outer rim of the city as homelessness rises (2001).In the late 1980s, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the <this country>ese government had designed a project to develop rural infrastructure. The project focused on improving roads, water supply and sanitation, and educational, health and social facilities because economic development in the communes and rural areas surrounding <this city> is dependent on the infrastructural links between the rural and urban areas, especially for the sale of rural products. The project aimed to use locally available resources and knowledge such as compressed earth construction techniques for building. It was jointly funded by the UNDP, the <this country>ese government, and resources raised by the local communities and governments. In four communes, the local communities contributed 37% of the total budget. Local labor, community support, and joint funding were decided as necessary for the long-term sustainability of the project.\n\nCivil society development\nPart of the goals of the \u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi economic reforms was to decentralize governance for purpose of economic improvement. This led to the establishment of the first issue-oriented civic organizations in <this city>. In the 1990s, <this city> experienced significant poverty alleviation as a result of both the market reforms and civil society movements. Most of the civic organizations in <this city> were established after 1995, at a rate much slower than in Ho Chi Minh City. Organizations in <this city> are more \"tradition-bound\", focused on policy, education, research, professional interests, and appealing to governmental organizations to solve social problems. This marked difference from Ho Chi Minh's civic organizations, which practice more direct intervention to tackle social issues, may be attributed to the different societal identities of North and South <this country>. <this city>-based civic organizations use more systematic development and less of a direct intervention approach to deal with issues of rural development, poverty alleviation, and environmental protection. They rely more heavily on full-time staff than volunteers. In <this city>, 16.7% of civic organizations accept anyone as a registered member and 73.9% claim to have their own budgets, as opposed to 90.9% in Ho Chi Minh City. A majority of the civic organizations in <this city> find it difficult to work with governmental organizations. Many of the strained relations between non-governmental and governmental organizations results from statism, a bias against non-state organizations on the part of government entities.\n\nLandmarks\nAs the capital of <this country> for almost a thousand years, <this city> is considered one of the main cultural centres of <this country>, where most <this country>ese dynasties have left their imprint. Even though some relics have not survived through wars and time, the city still has many interesting cultural and historic monuments for visitors and residents alike. Even when the nation's capital moved to Hu\u1ebf under the Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty in 1802, the city of <this city> continued to flourish, especially after the French took control in 1888 and modeled the city's architecture to their tastes, lending an important aesthetic to the city's rich stylistic heritage. The city hosts more cultural sites than any other city in <this country>, and boasts more than 1,000 years of history; that of the past few hundred years has been well preserved.\n\nOld Quarter\nThe Old Quarter, near Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm Lake, maintains most of the original street layout and some of the architecture of old <this city>. At the beginning of the 20th century <this city> consisted of the \"36 streets\", the citadel, and some of the newer French buildings south of Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm lake, most of which are now part of Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm district. Each street had merchants and households specializing in a particular trade, such as silk, jewelry or even bamboo. The street names still reflect these specializations, although few of them remain exclusively in their original commerce. The area is famous for its specializations in trades such as traditional medicine and local handicrafts, including silk shops, bamboo carpenters, and tin smiths. Local cuisine specialties as well as several clubs and bars can be found here also. A night market (near \u0110\u1ed3ng Xu\u00e2n Market) in the heart of the district opens for business every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday evening with a variety of clothing, souvenirs and food.\nWent through more than six decades of French colonization and centuries of sociocultural influence from China, French and Chinese cultures have influenced the designs of the old houses in <this city>. The Franco-Chinese or hybrid architecture in <this country> have shown, the \u201ccultural additivity\u201d in <this country>ese architecture is reflected in the front of a house in the co-existence of French-styled columns, Confucian scrolls, the Taoist yin-yang sign, and the Buddhist lotus sculpture.\n\nImperial sites\nImperior sites are mostly in Ba \u0110\u00ecnh District and a bit of \u0110\u1ed1ng \u0110a District. They are juxtaposed with French colonial architecture (villas, administrative buildings and tree-lined boulevards). Some prominent edifices from feudal time include the Temple of Literature (V\u0103n Mi\u1ebfu), site of the oldest university in <this country> which was started in 1010, the One Pillar Pagoda (Ch\u00f9a M\u1ed9t C\u1ed9t) which was built based on the dream of king L\u00fd Th\u00e1i T\u00f4ng (1028\u20131054) in 1049, and the Flag Tower of <this city> (C\u1ed9t c\u1edd H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i). In 2004, a massive part of the 900-year-old <this city> Citadel was discovered in central <this city>, near the site of Ba \u0110\u00ecnh Square.\n\nLakes\nA city between rivers built on lowlands, <this city> has many scenic lakes and is sometimes called the \"city of lakes\". Among its lakes, the most famous are Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm Lake, West Lake, Tr\u00fac B\u1ea1ch Lake and B\u1ea3y M\u1eabu Lake (inside Th\u1ed1ng Nh\u1ea5t Park). Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm Lake, also known as Sword Lake, is the historical and cultural center of <this city>, and is linked to the legend of the magic sword. West Lake (H\u1ed3 T\u00e2y) is a popular place for people to spend time. It is the largest lake in <this city>, with many temples in the area. The lakeside road in the Nghi Tam \u2013 Quang Ba area is perfect for bicycling, jogging and viewing the cityscape or enjoying the lotus ponds in the summer. The best way to see the majestic beauty of a West Lake sunset is to view it from one of the many bars around the lake, especially from The Summit at Pan Pacific <this city> (formally known as Summit Lounge at Sofitel Plaza <this city>).\n\nColonial <this city>\n<this city> was the capital and the administrative center for French Indochina for most of the colonial period (from 1902 to 1945). The French colonial architectural style became dominant, and many examples remain today: tree-lined boulevards (such as Phan Dinh Phung street, Hoang Dieu street and Tran Phu street) and many villas, mansions, and government buildings. Some notable colonial structures are an eclectic mixture of French and traditional <this country>ese architectural styles, such as the National Museum of <this country>ese History, the <this country> National Museum of Fine Arts and the old Indochina Medical College. Gouveneur-G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Paul Doumer (1898\u20131902) played a crucial role in colonial <this city>'s urban planning. Under his tenure there was a major construction boom.French Colonial buildings in <this city> are mostly in Ba \u0110\u00ecnh District and the south of Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm District, the two French Quarters of the city. Notable landmarks include:\nIn Ba \u0110\u00ecnh district:\n\nPresidential Palace\nC\u1eeda B\u1eafc Church\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs building\nSeveral ministries, government agencies and foreign embassiesIn Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm district:\n\nGrand Opera House\nSt. Joseph's Cathedral\nLong Bi\u00ean Bridge\nGrand Palais\nFrench School of the Far East\nHotel Metropole\nTonkin Palace (State Guest House)\nH\u1ecfa L\u00f2 Prison\nSupreme Court building\nIndochina Medical College\nMuseum of Revolution\nCentral Station\nState Bank of <this country>\nSeveral foreign embassies\n\nMuseums\n<this city> is home to a number of museums:\n\nNational Museum of <this country>ese History\n<this country> National Museum of Fine Arts\n<this country> Museum of Ethnology\n<this country> Museum of Revolution\nH\u1ecfa L\u00f2 Prison\nHo Chi Minh Museum\n<this city> Contemporary Arts Centre\n<this country> Military History Museum\n<this city> Museum\n\nSuburbs\n<this city>'s western suburbs, previously H\u00e0 T\u00e2y Province, offers a number of important religious sites:\n\nThe Th\u1ea7y Pagoda in Qu\u1ed1c Oai District was established in the 11th century and dedicated to <this country>ese Thi\u1ec1n master T\u1eeb \u0110\u1ea1o H\u1ea1nh. It is one of the oldest Buddhist temples in <this country>.\nThe Perfume Pagoda is a vast complex of Buddhist temples and shrines built into the limestone Huong Tich mountains. It has a long pilgrimage route along the Yen river.\n\nTourism\nAccording to Mastercard\u2019s 2019 report, <this city> is <this country>'s most visited city (15th in Asia Pacific), with 4.8 million overnight international visitors in 2018. <this city> is sometimes dubbed the \"Paris of the East\" for its French influences. With its tree-fringed boulevards, more than two dozen lakes and thousands of French colonial-era buildings, <this city> is a popular tourist destination.\nThe tourist destinations in <this city> are generally grouped into two main areas: the Old Quarter and the French Quarter(s). The \"Old Quarter\" is in the northern half of Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm District with small street blocks and alleys, and a traditional <this country>ese atmosphere. Many streets in the Old Quarter have names signifying the goods (\"h\u00e0ng\") the local merchants were or are specialized in. For example, \"H\u00e0ng B\u1ea1c\" (silver stores) still have many stores specializing in trading silver and jewelries.\nTwo areas are generally called the \"French Quarters\": the governmental area in Ba \u0110\u00ecnh District and the south of Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm District. Both areas have distinctive French Colonial style villas and broad tree-lined avenues.\nThe political center of <this country>, Ba \u0110\u00ecnh has a high concentration of <this country>ese government headquarters, including the Presidential Palace, the National Assembly Building, and several ministries and embassies, most of which used administrative buildings of colonial French Indochina. The One Pillar Pagoda, the Lyc\u00e9e du Protectorat and the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum are also in Ba Dinh.\nSouth of Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm's \"French Quarter\" has several French-Colonial landmarks, including the <this city> Opera House, the Sofitel Legend Metropole <this city> hotel, the National Museum of <this country>ese History (formerly the \u00c9cole fran\u00e7aise d'Extr\u00eame-Orient), and the St. Joseph's Cathedral. Most of the French-Colonial buildings in Hoan Kiem are now used as foreign embassies.\nSince 2014, <this city> has consistently been voted in the world's top ten destinations by TripAdvisor. It ranked eighth in 2014, fourth in 2015 and eighth in 2016.\n<this city> is the most affordable international destination in TripAdvisor's annual TripIndex report. In 2017, <this city> will welcome more than 5 million international tourists.\n\nEntertainment\nA variety of options for entertainment in <this city> can be found throughout the city. Modern and traditional theaters, cinemas, karaoke bars, dance clubs, bowling alleys, and an abundance of opportunities for shopping provide leisure activity for both locals and tourists. <this city> has been named one of the top 10 cities for shopping in Asia by Water Puppet Tours. The number of art galleries exhibiting <this country>ese art has dramatically increased in recent years, now including galleries such as \"Nhat Huy\" of Huynh Thong Nhat.\nNh\u00e0 Tri\u1ec3n L\u00e3m at 29 Hang Bai street hosts regular photo, sculpture, and paint exhibitions in conjuncture with local artists and travelling international expositions.\nA popular traditional form of entertainment is water puppetry, which is shown, for example, at the Th\u0103ng Long Water Puppet Theatre.\n\nShopping\nTo adapt to <this city>'s rapid economic growth and high population density, many modern shopping centers and megamalls have been opened in <this city>.\nMajor malls are:\n\nTrang Tien Plaza, High-end Mall on Trang Tien street (right next to Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm Lake), Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm District\nVincom Center, a modern mall with hi-end CGV cineplex, Ba Trieu Street (just 2 km from Hoan Kiem lake), Hai B\u00e0 Tr\u01b0ng District\nThe Garden Shopping Center, Me Tri \u2013 M\u1ef9 \u0110\u00ecnh, Nam T\u1eeb Li\u00eam District\nIndochina Plaza, Xuan Thuy street, C\u1ea7u Gi\u1ea5y District\nVincom Royal City Megamall, the largest underground mall in Asia with 230,000 square metres of shops, restaurants, cineplex, waterpark (formerly), cinema, ice skating rink; Nguyen Trai street (approx 6 km from Hoan Kiem Lake), Thanh Xu\u00e2n District\nVincom Times City Megamall, another megamall of 230,000 square metres including shops, restaurants, cineplex, huge musical fountain on central square and a giant aquarium; Minh Khai street (approx 5 km from Hoan Kiem Lake), Hai Ba Trung district\nLotte Department Store, opened September 2014, Lieu Giai Street, Ba \u0110\u00ecnh District\nAeon Mall Long Bien opened last October 2015, Long Bien District\nAeon Mall Ha Dong opened in the end of 2019, Ha Dong district\n\nCuisine\n<this city> has rich culinary traditions. Many of <this country>'s most famous dishes, such as ph\u1edf, b\u00fan ch\u1ea3, ch\u1ea3 c\u00e1 L\u00e3 V\u1ecdng, b\u00e1nh cu\u1ed1n and c\u1ed1m are believed to have originated in <this city>. Two varieties of ph\u1edf dominate the <this city> scene: ph\u1edf b\u00f2, containing beef, and ph\u1edf g\u00e0, containing chicken. B\u00fan ch\u1ea3, a dish consisting of charcoal roasted pork served in a sweet/salty soup with rice noodle vermicelli and lettuce, is by far the most popular food item among locals. President Barack Obama famously tried this dish at a Le Van Huu eatery with Anthony Bourdain in 2016, prompting the opening of a b\u00fan ch\u1ea3 restaurant bearing his name in the Old Quarter.\n<this country>'s national dish ph\u1edf has been named as one of the Top 5 street foods in the world by globalpost.<this city> has a number of restaurants whose menus specifically offer dishes containing snake and various species of insects. Insect-inspired menus can be found at a number of restaurants in Khuong Thuong village, <this city>. The signature dishes at these restaurant are those containing processed ant-eggs, often in the culinary styles of Thai people or <this country>'s Muong and Tay ethnic people. Dog eating used to be popular in <this city> in 1990s and early 2000s but is now dying out quickly due to strong objections.\n\nEducation\n<this city>, as the capital of French Indochina, was home to the first Western-style universities in Indochina, including: Indochina Medical College (1902) \u2013 now <this city> Medical University, Indochina University (1904) \u2013 now <this city> National University (the largest), and \u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts de l'Indochine (1925) \u2013 now <this city> University of Fine Art.\nAfter the Communist Party of <this country> took control of <this city> in 1954, many new universities were built, among them, <this city> University of Science and Technology. Recently ULIS (University of Languages and International Studies) was rated as one of the top universities in south-east Asia for languages and language studies at the undergraduate level. Other universities that are not part of <this country> National University or <this city> University include <this city> School for Public Health, <this city> School of Agriculture, Electric Power University and University of Transport and Communications.\nIt is estimated that 62% of the scientists in the whole country are living and working in <this city>. Admissions to undergraduate study are through entrance examinations, which are conducted annually and open to everyone (who has successfully completed his/her secondary education) in the country. The majority of universities in <this city> are public, although in recent years a number of private universities have begun operation. Th\u0103ng Long University, founded in 1988, by <this country>ese mathematics professors in <this city> and France was the first private university in <this country>. Because many of <this country>'s major universities are located in <this city>, students from other provinces (especially in the northern part of the country) wishing to enter university often travel to <this city> for the annual entrance examination. Such events usually take place in June and July, during which a large number of students and their families converge on the city for several weeks around the intense examination period. In recent years, these entrance exams have been centrally coordinated by the Ministry of Education, but entrance requirements are decided independently by each university.\nAlthough there are state owned kindergartens, there are also many private ventures that serve both local and international needs. Pre-tertiary (elementary and secondary) schools in <this city> are generally state run, but there are also some independent schools. Education is equivalent to the K\u201312 system in the U.S., with elementary school between grades 1 and 5, middle school (or junior high) between grades 6 and 9, and high school from grades 10 to 12. There are several specialised school (or high school for the gifted) in <this city> where excellent students in <this city> attend. Some schools include:\n\u2022 <this city> \u2013 Amsterdam High School\n\u2022 Chu Van An High School\n\u2022 Foreign Language Specialized School\n\u2022 Nguyen Hue High School for the Gifted\n\u2022 High School for Gifted Students, <this city> National University of Education\n\u2022 High School for Gifted Students, <this city> University of Science\nEducation levels are much higher within the city of <this city> in comparison to the suburban areas outside the city. About 33.8% of the labor force in the city has completed secondary school in contrast to 19.4% in the suburbs. 21% of the labor force in the city has completed tertiary education in contrast to 4.1% in the suburbs.International schools include:\n\nBritish International School <this city>\nBritish <this country>ese International School <this city>\n<this city> International School\nJapanese School of <this city>\nKorean International School in <this city>\nLyc\u00e9e fran\u00e7ais Alexandre Yersin\nUnited Nations International School of <this city>\n<this country>-Australia School, <this city>Former schools:\n\nLyc\u00e9e Albert Sarraut\n\nReform\nCountry-wide educational change is difficult in <this country>, due to the restrictive control of the government on social and economic development strategies. According to <this city> government publications, the national system of education was reformed in 1950, 1956 and 1970. It was not until 1975 when the two separate education systems of the former North and South <this country> territories became unified under a single national system. In <this city> in December 1996, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of <this country> stated that: \"To carry out industrialization and modernization successfully, it is necessary to develop education and training strongly [and to] maximize human resources, the key factor of fast and sustained development.\"\n\nTransportation\n<this city> has 1,370 streets and roads with the total length of over 2,300 km (1,429 mi); 573 bridges, of which 483 small to middle bridges, 13 light overpasses for vehicle, 70 pedestrian overpasses and 7 main bridges (Ch\u01b0\u01a1ng D\u01b0\u01a1ng, V\u0129nh Tuy, Thanh Tr\u00ec, Nh\u1eadt T\u00e2n, \u0110\u00f4ng Tr\u00f9, Th\u0103ng Long, and Ph\u00f9ng); 115 tunnels, including 9 main tunnels, 39 pedestrian tunnels and 67 underpass. In total, the proportion of land for traffic in the city 2021 is 10.3%. The city also has 63 km (39 mi) of inland waterway, which are Y\u1ebfn stream, Hai stream, C\u00e0 L\u1ed3 and \u0110\u00e1y river.<this city> is served by Noi Bai International Airport, located in the Soc Son District, approximately 15 km (9 mi) north of <this city>. The new international terminal (T2), designed and built by Japanese contractors, opened in January 2015 and is a big facelift for the airport. In addition, a new highway and the new Nhat Tan cable-stay bridge connecting the airport and the city center opened at the same time, offering much more convenience than the old road (via Thang Long bridge). Taxis are plentiful and usually have meters, although it is also common to agree on the trip price before taking a taxi from the airport to the city centre.\n<this city> is also the origin or departure point for many <this country> Railways train routes in the country with 6 national railway lines pass through the city with a total length of 162 km (101 mi). The Reunification Express (t\u00e0u Th\u1ed1ng Nh\u1ea5t) runs from <this city> to Ho Chi Minh City from <this city> station (formerly Hang Co station), with stops at cities and provinces along the line. Trains also depart <this city> frequently for Hai Phong and other northern cities. The Reunification Express line was established during French colonial rule and was completed over a period of nearly forty years, from 1899 to 1936. The Reunification Express between <this city> and Ho Chi Minh City covers a distance of 1,726 km (1,072 mi) and takes approximately 33 hours. As of 2005, there were 278 stations on the <this country>ese railway network, of which 191 were located along the north\u2013south line.\nThe main means of transport within <this city> city are motorbikes, buses, taxis, and a rising number of cars. In recent decades, motorbikes have overtaken bicycles as the main form of transportation. Cars however are probably the most notable change in the past five years as many <this country>ese people purchase the vehicles for the first time. The increased number of cars are the main cause of gridlock as roads and infrastructure in the older parts of <this city> were not designed to accommodate them. On 4 July 2017, the <this city> government voted to ban motorbikes entirely by 2030, to reduce pollution, congestion, and encourage the expansion and use of public transport. Number of vehicles registered in <this city> as of July 2022 is over 7.6 million, including more than 1 million cars, over 6.4 million motorcycles of and 179,000 electric motorbikes. This figure does not include vehicles of the armed forces, diplomatic missions and other localities's vehicles operating in <this city>.There are two metro lines in <this city>, one of which is under construction, as part of the master plan for the future <this city> Metro system. Line 2A opened on 6 November 2021, while line 3 is expected to begin operation in 2023.\nPersons on their own or traveling in a pair who wish to make a fast trip around <this city> to avoid traffic jams or to travel at an irregular time or by way of an irregular route often use \"xe \u00f4m\" (literally, \"hug bike\"). Motorbikes can also be rented from agents within the Old Quarter of <this city>, although this falls inside a rather grey legal area.\n\nSports\nThere are several gymnasiums and stadiums throughout the city of <this city>.
