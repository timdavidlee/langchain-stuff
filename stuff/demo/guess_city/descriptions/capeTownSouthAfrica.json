  "wiki_text": "<this city> is <this country>'s oldest city. It serves as the country's legislative capital, being the seat of the <this country>n Parliament. It is the country's second-largest city (after Johannesburg) and the largest in the Western Cape. The city is part of the City of <this city> metropolitan municipality.\nThe city is known for its harbour, its natural setting in the Cape Floristic Region, and for landmarks such as Table Mountain and Cape Point. In 2014, <this city> was named the best place in the world to visit by The New York Times and similarly by The Daily Telegraph in 2016.Located on the shore of Table Bay, the City Bowl area of <this city> is the oldest urban area in the Western Cape, with a significant cultural heritage. It was founded by the Dutch East India Company (VOC) as a supply station for Dutch ships sailing to East Africa, India, and the Far East. Jan van Riebeeck's arrival on 6 April 1652 established the VOC Cape Colony, the first permanent European settlement in <this country>. <this city> outgrew its original purpose as the first European outpost at the Castle of Good Hope, becoming the economic and cultural hub of the Cape Colony. Until the Witwatersrand Gold Rush and the development of Johannesburg, <this city> was the largest city in southern Africa.\nThe metropolitan area has a long coastline on the Atlantic Ocean, which includes False Bay, and extends to the Hottentots Holland mountains to the east. The Table Mountain National Park is within the city boundaries and there are several other nature reserves and marine-protected areas within, and adjacent to, the city, protecting the diverse terrestrial and marine natural environment.\n\nHistory\nEarly period\nThe earliest known remnants of human occupation in the region were found at Peers Cave in Fish Hoek and have been dated to between 15,000 and 12,000 years old.Little is known of the history of the region's first residents, since there is no written history from the area before it was first mentioned by Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias. Dias, the first European to reach the area, arrived in 1488 and named it \"Cape of Storms\" (Cabo das Tormentas). It was later renamed by John II of Portugal as \"Cape of Good Hope\" (Cabo da Boa Esperan\u00e7a) because of the great optimism engendered by the opening of a sea route to the Indian subcontinent and East Indies. \nIn 1497, Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama recorded a sighting of the Cape of Good Hope. \nIn 1510, at the Battle of Salt River, the Portuguese admiral Francisco de Almeida and sixty-four of his men were killed and his party was defeated by the !Uri\u01c1\u2019aekua (\"Goringhaiqua\" in Dutch approximate spelling) using specially trained cattle. The !Uri\u01c1\u2019aekua were one of the so-called Khoekhoe clans who inhabited the area. \nIn the late 16th century French, Danish, Dutch and English, but mainly Portuguese, ships regularly continued to stop over in Table Bay en route to the Indies. They traded tobacco, copper, and iron with the Khoekhoe clans of the region in exchange for fresh meat and other essential travelling provisions.\n\nDutch period\nIn 1652, Jan van Riebeeck and other employees of the United East India Company (Dutch: Verenigde Oost-indische Compagnie, VOC) were sent to  the Cape Colony to establish a way-station for ships travelling to the Dutch East Indies, and the Fort de Goede Hoop (later replaced by the Castle of Good Hope). The settlement grew slowly during this period, as it was hard to find adequate labour. This labour shortage prompted the local authorities to import enslaved people from Indonesia and Madagascar. Many of these people are ancestors of modern-day Cape Coloured communities.Under Van Riebeeck and his successors, as VOC commanders and later governors at the Cape, a wide range of agricultural plants were introduced to the Cape. Some of these, including grapes, cereals, ground nuts, potatoes, apples and citrus, had a large and lasting influence on the societies and economies of the region.\n\nBritish period\nWith the Dutch Republic being transformed into Revolutionary France's vassal Batavian Republic, Great Britain moved to take control of Dutch colonies, including the colonial possessions of the VOC. \nBritain captured <this city> in 1795, but it was returned to the Dutch by treaty in 1803. British forces occupied the Cape again in 1806 following the Battle of Blaauwberg when the successor state to the Batavian Republic, the Kingdom of Holland, allied with France during the Napoleonic Wars. \nIn the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814, <this city> was permanently ceded to the United Kingdom. It became the capital of the newly formed Cape Colony, whose territory expanded very substantially through the 1800s. With expansion came calls for greater independence from the UK, with the Cape attaining its own parliament (1854) and a locally accountable Prime Minister (1872). Suffrage was established according to the non-racial Cape Qualified Franchise.During the 1850s and 1860s, additional plant species were introduced from Australia by the British authorities. Notably rooikrans was introduced to stabilise the sand of the Cape Flats to allow for a road connecting the peninsula with the rest of the African continent and eucalyptus was used to drain marshes.In 1859 the first railway line was built by the Cape Government Railways and a system of railways rapidly expanded in the 1870s. The discovery of diamonds in Griqualand West in 1867, and the Witwatersrand Gold Rush in 1886, prompted a flood of immigration into <this country>. In 1895 the city's first public power station, the Graaff Electric Lighting Works, was opened.\nConflicts between the Boer republics in the interior and the British colonial government resulted in the Second Boer War of 1899\u20131902. Britain's victory in this war led to the formation of a united <this country>. From 1891 to 1901, the city's population more than doubled from 67,000 to 171,000.As the 19th century came to an end, the economic and political dominance of <this city> in the Southern Africa region during the 19th century started to gave way to the dominance of Johannesburg and Pretoria in the 20th century.\n\n<this country>n period\nIn 1910, Britain established the Union of <this country>, which unified the Cape Colony with the two defeated Boer Republics and the British colony of Natal. <this city> became the legislative capital of the Union, and later of the Republic of <this country>. \nBy the time of the 1936 census, Johannesburg had overtaken <this city> as the largest city in the country.\n\nApartheid era\nPrior to the mid-twentieth century, <this city> was one of the most racially integrated cities in <this country>. In the 1948 national elections, the National Party won on a platform of apartheid (racial segregation) under the slogan of \"swart gevaar\" (Afrikaans for \"black danger\"). This led to the erosion and eventual abolition of the Cape's multiracial franchise. \nIn 1950, the apartheid government first introduced the Group Areas Act, which classified and segregated urban areas according to race. Formerly multi-racial suburbs of <this city> were either purged of residents deemed unlawful by apartheid legislation, or demolished. The most infamous example of this in <this city> was the suburb of District Six. After it was declared a whites-only area in 1965, all housing there was demolished and over 60,000 residents were forcibly removed. Many of these residents were relocated to the Cape Flats.\nThe earliest of the Cape Flats forced removals saw the expulsion of Black <this country>ns to the Langa township in line with the 1923 Native Urban Areas Act. Langa is the oldest township in <this city> and the scene of much resistance against apartheid. Its origins go back to the 19th century. \nUnder apartheid, the Cape was considered a \"Coloured labour preference area\", to the exclusion of \"Bantus\", i.e. Black Africans. The implementation of this policy was widely opposed by trade unions, civil society and opposition parties. It is notable that this policy was not advocated for by any Coloured political group, and its implementation was a unilateral decision by the apartheid government. During the student-led Soweto Uprising of June 1976, school students from Langa, Gugulethu and Nyanga in <this city> reacted to the news of the protests against Bantu Education by organising gatherings and marches of their own. A number of school buildings were burnt down and the protest action was met with forceful resistance from the police.<this city> has been home to many leaders of the anti-apartheid movement. In Table Bay, 10 km (6 mi) from the city is Robben Island. This penitentiary island was the site of a maximum security prison where many famous apartheird-era political prisoners served long prison sentences. Famous prisoners include activist, lawyer and future president Nelson Mandela who served 18 of his 27 years of imprisonment on the island, as well as two other future presidents, Kgalema Motlanthe and Jacob Zuma.\nIn one of the most famous moments marking the end of apartheid, Nelson Mandela made his first public speech since his imprisonment, from the balcony of <this city> City Hall, hours after being released on 11 February 1990. His speech heralded the beginning of a new era for the country. The first democratic election, was held four years later, on 27 April 1994. \nNobel Square in the Victoria & Alfred Waterfront features statues of <this country>'s four Nobel Peace Prize winners: Albert Luthuli, Desmond Tutu, F. W. de Klerk and Nelson Mandela.\n\nPost-apartheid era\n<this city> faced a severe water shortage from 2015 to 2018.Since the 2010s, <this city> and the wider Western Cape province have seen the rise of a small secessionist movement. Support for parties \"which have formally adopted Cape independence\" was around 5% in the 2021 municipal elections.\n\nGeography and the natural environment\n<this city> is located at latitude 33.55\u00b0 S (approximately the same as Sydney and Buenos Aires and equivalent to Casablanca and Los Angeles in the northern hemisphere) and longitude 18.25\u00b0 E. \nTable Mountain, with its near vertical cliffs and flat-topped summit over 1,000 m (3,300 ft) high, and with Devil's Peak and Lion's Head on either side, together form a dramatic mountainous backdrop enclosing the central area of <this city>, the so-called City Bowl. A thin strip of cloud, known colloquially as the \"tablecloth\" (\"Karos\" in Afrikaans), sometimes forms on top of the mountain. To the immediate south of the city, the Cape Peninsula is a scenic mountainous spine jutting 40 km (25 mi) southward into the Atlantic Ocean and terminating at Cape Point. \nThere are over 70 peaks above 300 m (980 ft) within <this city>'s official metropolitan limits. Many of the city's suburbs lie on the large plain called the Cape Flats, which extends over 50 km (30 mi) to the east and joins the peninsula to the mainland. The <this city> region is characterised by an extensive coastline, rugged mountain ranges, coastal plains and inland valleys.\n\nExtent\nThe extent of <this city> has varied considerably over time. It originated as a small settlement at the foot of Table Mountain and has grown beyond its city limits as a metropolitan area to encompass the entire Cape Peninsula to the south, the Cape Flats, the Helderberg basin and part of the Steenbras catchment area to the east, and the Tygerberg hills, Blouberg and other areas to the north. Robben Island in Table Bay is also part of <this city>. It is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and False Bay to the south. To the north and east, the extent is demarcated by boundaries of neighbouring municipalities within the Western Cape province.\nThe municipal boundaries of the city proper extend between the City Bowl and the Atlantic Seaboard to the east and the Southern Suburbs to the south. The City of <this city>, the metropolitan municipality that takes its name from the city covers the Greater <this city> metropolitan area, known as the Cape Metropole, extending beyond the city proper itself to include a number of satellite towns, suburbs and rural areas such as Milnerton, Atlantis, Bellville, Brackenfell, Durbanville, Goodwood, Gordon\u2019s Bay, Hout Bay, Kraaifontein, Kuilsrivier, Muizenberg, Simon\u2019s Town, Somerset West and Strand among others.The Cape Peninsula is 52 km (30 mi) long from Mouille Point in the north to Cape Point in the south, with an area of about 470 km2 (180 sq mi), and it displays more topographical variety than other similar sized areas in southern Africa, and consequently spectacular scenery. There are diverse low-nutrient soils, large rocky outcrops, scree slopes, a mainly rocky coastline with embayed beaches, and considerable local variation in climatic conditions. The sedimentary rocks of the Cape Supergroup, of which parts of the Graafwater and Peninsula Formations remain, were uplifted between 280 and 21S million years ago, and were largely eroded away during the Mesozoic. The region was geologically stable during the Tertiary, which has led to slow denudation of the durable sandstones. Erosion rate and drainage has been influenced by fault lines and fractures, leaving remnant steep-sided massifs like Table Mountain surrounded by flatter slopes of deposits of the eroded material overlaying the older rocks,There are two internationally notable landmarks, Table Mountain and Cape Point, at opposite ends of the Peninsula Mountain Chain, with the Cape Flats and False Bay to the east and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The landscape is dominated by sandstone plateaux and ridges, which generally drop steeply at their margins to the surrounding debris slopes, interrupted by a major gap at the Fish Hoek\u2013Noordhoek valley. In the south much of the area is a low sandstone plateau with sand dunes. Maximum altitude is 1113 m on Table Mountain. The Cape Flats (Afrikaans: Kaapse Vlakte) is a flat, low-lying, sandy area, area to the east the Cape Peninsula, and west of the Helderberg much of which was wetland and dunes within recent history. To the north are the Tygerberg Hills and the Stellenbosch district.\nThe Helderberg area of Greater <this city>, previously known as the \"Hottentots-Holland\" area, is mostly residential, but also a wine-producing area east of the Cape Flats, west of the Hottentots Holland mountain range and south of the Helderberg mountain, from which it gets its current name. The Helderberg consists of the previous municipalities of Somerset West, Strand, Gordons Bay and a few other towns. Industry and commerce is largely in service of the area. After the Cape Peninsula, Helderberg is the next most mountainous part of Greater <this city>, bordered to the north and east by the highest peaks in the region along the watershed of the Helderberg and Hottentots Holland Mountains, which are part of the Cape Fold Belt with Cape Supergroup strata on a basement of Tygerberg Formation rocks intruded by part of the Stellenbosch granite pluton. The region includes the entire catchment of the Lourens and Sir Lowry's rivers, separated by the Schapenberg hill, and a small part of the catchment of the Eerste River to the west. The Helderberg is ecologically highly diverse, rivaling the Cape Peninsula, and has its own enndemic ecoregions and several conservation areas.\nTo the east of the Hottentots Holland mountains is the valley of the Steenbras River, in which the Steenbras Dam was built as a water supply for <this city>. The dam has been supplemented by several other dams around the western Cape, some of them considerably larger. This is almost entirely a conservation area, of high biodiversity. Bellville, Brackenfell, Durbanville, Kraaifontein, Goodwood and Parow are a few of the towns that make up the Northern Suburbs of <this city>. In current popular culture these areas are often referred to as being beyond the \"boerewors curtain,\" a play on the term \"iron curtain.\"\nUNESCO declared Robben Island in the Western Cape a World Heritage Site in 1999. Robben Island is located in Table Bay, some 6 km (3.7 mi) west of Bloubergstrand, a coastal suburb north of <this city>, and stands some 30m above sea level. Robben Island has been used as a prison where people were isolated, banished, and exiled for nearly 400 years. It was also used as a leper colony, a post office, a grazing ground, a mental hospital, and an outpost.\n\nGeology\nThe Cape Peninsula is a rocky and mountainous peninsula that juts out into the Atlantic Ocean at the south-western extremity of the continent. At its tip is Cape Point and the Cape of Good Hope. The peninsula forms the west side of False Bay and the Cape Flats. On the east side are the Helderberg and Hottentots Holland mountains. The three main rock formations are the late-Precambrian Malmebury group (sedimentary and metamorphic rock), the Cape Granite suit, comprising the huge Peninsula, Kuilsrivier-Helderberg, and Stellenbosch batholiths, that were intruded into the Malmesbury Group about 630 million years ago, and the Table Mountain group sandstones that were deposited on the eroded surface of the granite and Malmesbury series basement about 450 million years ago. \nThe sand, silt and mud deposits were lithified by pressure and then folded during the Cape Orogeny to form the Cape Fold Belt, which extends in an arc along the western and southern coasts. The present landscape is due to prolonged erosion having carved out deep valleys, removing parts of the once continuous Table Mountain Group sandstone cover from over the Cape Flats and False Bay, and leaving high residual mountain ridges.At times the sea covered the Cape Flats and Noordhoek valley and the Cape Peninsula was then a group of islands. During glacial periods the sea level dropped to expose the bottom of False Bay to weathering and erosion, with the last major regression leaving the entire bottom of False Bay exposed. During this period an extensive system of dunes was formed on the sandy floor of False Bay. At this time the drainage outlets lay between Rocky Bank Cape Point to the west, and between Rocky Bank and Hangklip Ridge to the east, with the watershed roughly along the line of the contact zone east of Seal Island and Whittle Rock.:\u200aCh2\n\nClimate\n<this city> has a warm Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: Csb),\nwith mild, moderately wet winters and dry, warm summers. Winter, which lasts from the beginning of June to the end of August, may see large cold fronts entering for limited periods from the Atlantic Ocean with significant precipitation and strong north-westerly winds. Winter months in the city average a maximum of 18 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F) and minimum of 8.5 \u00b0C (47 \u00b0F)\nTotal annual rainfall in the city averages 515 mm (20.3 in) although in the Southern Suburbs, close to the mountains, rainfall is significantly higher and averages closer to 1,000 mm (39.4 in). \nSummer, which lasts from December to March, is warm and dry with an average maximum of 26 \u00b0C (79 \u00b0F) and minimum of 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F). The region can get uncomfortably hot when the Berg Wind, meaning \"mountain wind\", blows from the Karoo interior. Spring and summer generally feature a strong wind from the south-east, known locally as the south-easter or the Cape Doctor, so called because it blows air pollution away. This wind is caused by a persistent high-pressure system over the South Atlantic to the west of <this city>, known as the South Atlantic High, which shifts latitude seasonally, following the sun, and influencing the strength of the fronts and their northward reach. <this city> receives about 3,100 hours of sunshine per year.Water temperatures range greatly, between 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F) on the Atlantic Seaboard, to over 22 \u00b0C (72 \u00b0F) in False Bay. Average annual ocean surface temperatures are between 13 \u00b0C (55 \u00b0F) on the Atlantic Seaboard (similar to Californian waters, such as San Francisco or Big Sur), and 17 \u00b0C (63 \u00b0F) in False Bay (similar to Northern Mediterranean temperatures, such as Nice or Monte Carlo).\nUnlike other parts of the country the city does not have many thunderstorms, and most of those that do occur, happen around October to December and March to April.\n\nClimate change\nA 2019 paper published in PLOS One estimated that under Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5, a \"moderate\" scenario of climate change where global warming reaches ~2.5\u20133 \u00b0C (4.5\u20135.4 \u00b0F) by 2100, the climate of <this city> in the year 2050 would most closely resemble the current climate of Perth in Australia. The annual temperature would increase by 1.1 \u00b0C (2.0 \u00b0F), and the temperature of the coldest month by 0.3 \u00b0C (0.54 \u00b0F), while the temperature of the warmest month would be 2.3 \u00b0C (4.1 \u00b0F) higher. According to Climate Action Tracker, the current warming trajectory appears consistent with 2.7 \u00b0C (4.9 \u00b0F), which closely matches RCP 4.5.Moreover, according to the 2022 IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, <this city> is one of 12 major African cities (Abidjan, Alexandria, Algiers, <this city>, Casablanca, Dakar, Dar es Salaam, Durban, Lagos, Lom\u00e9, Luanda and Maputo) which would be the most severely affected by future sea level rise. It estimates that they would collectively sustain cumulative damages of USD 65 billion under RCP 4.5 and USD 86.5 billion for the high-emission scenario RCP 8.5 by the year 2050. Additionally, RCP 8.5 combined with the hypothetical impact from marine ice sheet instability at high levels of warming would involve up to 137.5 billion USD in damages, while the additional accounting for the \"low-probability, high-damage events\" may increase aggregate risks to USD 187 billion for the \"moderate\" RCP4.5, USD 206 billion for RCP8.5 and USD 397 billion under the high-end ice sheet instability scenario. Since sea level rise would continue for about 10,000 years under every scenario of climate change, future costs of sea level rise would only increase, especially without adaptation measures.\n\nHydrology\nSea surface temperatures\n<this city>'s coastal water ranges from cold to mild, and the difference between the two sides of the peninsula can be dramatic. While the Atlantic Seaboard averages annual sea surface temperatures around 13 \u00b0C (55 \u00b0F), the False Bay coast is much warmer, averaging between 16 and 17 \u00b0C (61 and 63 \u00b0F) annually. In summer, False Bay water averages slightly over 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F), with 22 \u00b0C (72 \u00b0F) an occasional high. Beaches located on the Atlantic Coast tend to have colder water due to the wind driven upwellings which contribute to the Benguela current which originates off the Cape Peninsula, while the water at False Bay beaches may occasionally be warmer by up to 10 \u00b0C (18 \u00b0F) at the same time in summer.\nIn summer False Bay is thermally stratified, with a vertical temperature variation of 5 to 9\u02daC between the warmer surface water and cooler depths below 50 m, while in winter the water column is at nearly constant temperature at all depths. The development of a thermocline is strongest around late December and peaks in late summer to early autumn.:\u200a8\u200a In summer the south easterly winds generate a zone of upwelling near Cape Hangklip, where surface water temperatures can be 6 to 7 \u00b0C colder than the surrounding areas, and bottom temperatures below 12 \u00b0C.:\u200a10\u200aIn the summer to early autumn (January\u2013March), cold water upwelling near Cape Hangklip causes a strong surface temperature gradient between the south-western and north-eastern corners of the bay. In winter the surface temperature tends to be much the same everywhere. In the northern sector surface temperature varies a bit more (13 to 22 \u00b0C) than in the south (14 to 20 \u00b0C) during the year.Surface temperature variation from year to year is linked to the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation. During El Ni\u00f1o years the South Atlantic high is shifted, reducing the south-easterly winds, so upwelling and evaporative cooling are reduced and sea surface temperatures throughout the bay are warmer, while in La Ni\u00f1a years there is more wind and upwelling and consequently lower temperatures. Surface water heating during El Ni\u00f1o increases vertical stratification. The relationship is not linear. Occasionally eddies from the Agulhas current will bring warmer water and vagrant sea life carried from the south and east coasts into False Bay.\n\nFlora and fauna\nLocated in a Conservation International biodiversity hotspot as well as the unique Cape Floristic Region, the city of <this city> has one of the highest levels of biodiversity of any equivalent area in the world. These protected areas are a World Heritage Site, and an estimated 2,200 species of plants are confined to Table Mountain \u2013 more than exist in the whole of the United Kingdom which has 1200 plant species and 67 endemic plant species. Many of these species, including a great many types of proteas, are endemic to the mountain and can be found nowhere else.It is home to a total of 19 different vegetation types, of which several are endemic to the city and occur nowhere else in the world.\nIt is also the only habitat of hundreds of endemic species, and hundreds of others which are severely restricted or threatened. This enormous species diversity is mainly because the city is uniquely located at the convergence point of several different soil types and micro-climates.Table Mountain has an unusually rich biodiversity. Its vegetation consists predominantly of several different types of the unique and rich Cape Fynbos. The main vegetation type is endangered Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos, but critically endangered Peninsula Granite Fynbos, Peninsula Shale Renosterveld and Afromontane forest occur in smaller portions on the mountain.\nRapid population growth and urban sprawl has covered much of these ecosystems with development. Consequently, <this city> now has over 300 threatened plant species and 13 which are now extinct. The Cape Peninsula, which lies entirely within the city of <this city>, has the highest concentration of threatened species of any continental area of equivalent size in the world.\nTiny remnant populations of critically endangered or near extinct plants sometimes survive on road sides, pavements and sports fields. The remaining ecosystems are partially protected through a system of over 30 nature reserves \u2013 including the massive Table Mountain National Park.<this city> reached first place in the 2019 iNaturalist City Nature Challenge in two out of the three categories: Most Observations, and Most Species. This was the first entry by Capetonians in this annual competition to observe and record the local biodiversity over a four-day long weekend during what is considered the worst time of the year for local observations. A worldwide survey suggested that the extinction rate of endemic plants from the City of <this city> is one of the highest in the world, at roughly three per year since 1900 \u2013 partly a consequence of the very small and localised habitats and high endemicity.\n\nGovernment\n<this city> is governed by a 231-member city council elected in a system of mixed-member proportional representation. The city is divided into 116 wards, each of which elects a councillor by first-past-the-post voting. The remaining 115 councillors are elected from party lists so that the total number of councillors for each party is proportional to the number of votes received by that party.In the 2021 Municipal Elections, the Democratic Alliance (DA) kept its majority, this time diminished, taking 136 seats. The African National Congress lost substantially, receiving 43 of the seats. The Democratic Alliance candidate for the <this city> mayoralty, Geordin Hill-Lewis was elected mayor.\n\nInternational relations\n<this city> has nineteen active sister city agreements\n\n2022 invasion of Ukraine\nThe City of <this city> has expressed explicit support for Ukraine during the 2022 invasion of the country by Russia. To show this support the City of <this city> lit up the Old City Hall in the colours of the Ukrainian flag on 2 March 2022. This has differentiated the city from the officially neutral foreign policy position taken by the <this country>n national government.\n\nDemographics\nAccording to the <this country>n National Census of 2011, the population of the City of <this city> metropolitan municipality \u2013 an area that includes suburbs and exurbs  \u2013 is 3,740,026 people.

Reaching the top of the mountain can be achieved either by hiking up, or by taking the Table Mountain Cableway. Cape Point is the dramatic headland at the end of the Cape Peninsula. Many tourists also drive along Chapman's Peak Drive, a narrow road that links Noordhoek with Hout Bay, for the views of the Atlantic Ocean and nearby mountains.

It is possible to visit several different beaches in the same day, each with a different setting and atmosphere.\nBoth coasts are popular, although the beaches in affluent Clifton and elsewhere on the Atlantic Coast are better developed with restaurants and caf\u00e9s, with a strip of restaurants and bars accessible to the beach at Camps Bay. The Atlantic seaboard, known as <this city>'s Riviera, is regarded as one of the most scenic routes in <this country>, along the slopes of the Twelve Apostles to the boulders and white sand beaches of Llandudno, with the route ending in Hout Bay, a diverse suburb with a fishing and recreational boating harbour near a small island with a breeding colony of African fur seals.

The primary focus of <this city> Tourism is to represent <this city> as a tourist destination. <this city> Tourism receives a portion of its funding from the City of <this city> while the remainder is made up of membership fees and own-generated funds. The Tristan da Cunha government owns and operates a lodging facility in <this city> which charges discounted rates to Tristan da Cunha residents and non-resident natives. <this city>'s transport system links it to the rest of <this country>; it serves as the gateway to other destinations within the province.

This provincial department is divided into seven districts; four of these are \"Metropole\" districts \u2013 Metropole Central, North, South, and East \u2013 which cover various areas of the city. There are also many private schools, both religious and secular. <this city> has a well-developed higher system of public universities. <this city> is served by three public universities: the University of <this city> (UCT), the University of the Western Cape (UWC) and the Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT). Stellenbosch University, while not based in the metropolitan area itself, has its main campus and administrative section 50 kilometres from the City Bowl and has additional campuses, such as the Tygerberg Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences and the Bellville Business Park, north-west of the city in the town of Bellville. \nBoth the University of <this city> and Stellenbosch University are leading universities in <this country>. This is due in large part to substantial financial contributions made to these institutions by both the public and private sector. UCT is an English-language tuition institution. It has over 21,000 students and has an MBA programme that was ranked 51st by the Financial Times in 2006. It is also the top-ranked university in Africa, being the only African university to make the world's Top 200 university list at number 146. Since the African National Congress has become the country's ruling party, some restructuring of Western Cape universities has taken place and as such, traditionally non-white universities have seen increased financing, which has evidently benefitted the University of the Western Cape.The Cape Peninsula University of Technology was formed on 1 January 2005, when two separate institutions \u2013 Cape Technikon and Peninsula Technikon \u2013 were merged. The new university offers education primarily in English, although one may take courses in any of <this country>'s official languages. The institution generally awards the National Diploma.

While dam water levels had been declining since 2015, the <this city> water crisis peaked during mid-2017 to mid-2018 when water levels hovered between 15 and 30 percent of total dam capacity.\nIn late 2017, there were first mentions of plans for \"Day Zero\", a shorthand reference for the day when the water level of the major dams supplying the city could fall below 13.5 percent. \"Day Zero\" would mark the start of Level 7 water restrictions, when municipal water supplies would be largely switched off and it was envisioned that residents could have to queue for their daily ration of water. If this had occurred, it would have made the City of <this city> the first major city in the world to run out of water.The city of <this city> implemented significant water restrictions in a bid to curb water usage, and succeeded in reducing its daily water usage by more than half to around 500 million litres (130,000,000 US gal) per day in March 2018. The fall in water usage led the city to postpone its estimate for \"Day Zero\", and strong rains starting in June 2018 led to dam levels recovering. In September 2018, with dam levels close to 70 percent, the city began easing water restrictions, indicating that the worst of the water crisis was over. Good rains in 2020 effectively broke the drought and resulting water shortage when dam levels reached 95 percent. Concerns have been raised, however, that unsustainble demand and limited water supply could result in future drought events.\n\nTransport\nAir\n<this city> International Airport serves both domestic and international flights. It is the second-largest airport in <this country> and serves as a major gateway for travelers to the Cape region. <this city> has regularly scheduled services to Southern Africa, East Africa, Mauritius, Middle East, Far East, Europe and the United States as well as eleven domestic destinations. <this city> International Airport opened a brand new central terminal building that was developed to handle an expected increase in air traffic as tourism numbers increased in the lead-up to the tournament of the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Other renovations include several large new parking garages, a revamped domestic departure terminal, a new Bus Rapid Transit system station and a new double-decker road system. The airport's cargo facilities are also being expanded and several large empty lots are being developed into office space and hotels.\n<this city> is one of five internationally recognised Antarctic gateway cities with transportation connections.

The R44 enters the east of the metro from the north, from Stellenbosch. It connects Stellenbosch to Somerset West, then crosses the N2 to Strand and Gordon's Bay. It exits the metro heading south hugging the coast, leading to the towns of Betty's Bay and Kleinmond.\nOf the three-digit routes, the R300 is an expressway linking the N1 at Brackenfell to the N2 near Mitchells Plain and the <this city> International Airport. The R302 runs from the R102 in Bellville, heading north across the N1 through Durbanville leaving the metro to Malmesbury. The R304 enters the northern limits of the metro from Stellenbosch, running NNW before veering west to cross the N7 at Philadelphia to end at Atlantis at a junction with the R307. This R307 starts north of Koeberg from the R27 and, after meeting the R304, continues north to Darling. The R310 originates from Muizenberg and runs along the coast, to the south of Mitchell's Plain and Khayelitsha, before veering north-east, crossing the N2 west of Macassar, and exiting the metro heading to Stellenbosch.\n<this city>, like most <this country>n cities, uses Metropolitan or \"M\" routes for important intra-city routes, a layer below National (N) roads and Regional (R) routes. Each city's M roads are independently numbered. Most are at-grade roads. The M3 splits from the N2 and runs to the south along the eastern slopes of Table Mountain, connecting the City Bowl with Muizenberg.

There is considerable variation in the underwater environment and regional ecology as there are dive sites on reefs and wrecks on both sides of the Cape Peninsula and False Bay, split between two coastal marine ecoregions by the Cape Peninsula, and also variable by depth zone.\n\nFalse Bay is open to the south, and the prevailing open ocean swell arrives from the southwest, so the exposure varies considerably around the coastline. The inshore bathymetry near Cape Point is shallow enough for a moderate amount of refraction of long period swell, but deep enough to have less effect on short period swell, and acts as a filter to pass mainly the longer swell components to the Western shores, although they are significantly attenuated. The eastern shores get more of the open ocean spectrum, and this results in very different swell conditions between the two sides at any given time. The fetch is generally too short for southeasterly winds to produce good surf. There are more than 20 named breaks in False Bay. The north-wester can have a long fetch and can produce large waves, but they may also be associated with local wind and be very poorly sorted. The Atlantic coast is exposed to the full power of the South-westerly swell produced by the westerly winds of the southern ocean, often a long way away, so the swell has time to separate into similar wavelengths, and there are some world class big wave breaks among the named breaks of the Atlantic shore.\n\nSee also\nCape Colony \u2013 British colony from 1806 to 1910\nTimeline of <this city> \u2013 Chronological listing of notable events\nWestern Cape \u2013 Province of <this country> on the south-western coast\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nLargest online collection of photos/Videos of the past by HiltonT on Flickr\nLargest online collection of photos/Videos of the past by Etienne du Plessis on Flickr\n<this city> Historic Society (many photos into past of what things used look like)\nCape To Durban, how British (1820 Settlers) explorered) (many photos into past of what things used look like)\n<this city> (Cape of Good Hope) \u2013 (Unofficial Index to all resource on the net) The history occurring on its land Relevant Reading Material\nBuilding of all <this country>n Railways into the interior of the Country \u2013 Video\nBritish Rolay Rolay Tour of <this country> Uncut \u2013 VideoOfficial website of the City of <this city>\nOfficial website of the Western Cape\nOfficial website of <this city> Tourism\n<this city> Tourism Guide website\n32675806  <this city> on OpenStreetMap\n7 Breathtaking Beaches In <this city>"
