  "wiki_text": "<this city> ( or ; Spanish pronunciation: [\u02c8bwenos \u02c8aj\u027ees] (listen)), officially the Autonomous City of <this city>, is the capital and primate city of <this country>. The city is located on the western shore of the R\u00edo de la Plata, on South America's southeastern coast. \"<this city>\" is Spanish for \"fair winds\" or \"good airs\". <this city> is classified as an alpha global city, according to the Globalization and World Cities Research Network (GaWC) 2020 ranking.The city of <this city> is neither part of <this city> Province nor the Province's capital; rather, it is an autonomous district. In 1880, after decades of political infighting, <this city> was federalized and removed from <this city> Province. The city limits were enlarged to include the towns of Belgrano and Flores; both are now neighborhoods of the city. The 1994 constitutional amendment granted the city autonomy, hence its formal name of Autonomous City of <this city>. Its citizens first elected a Chief of Government in 1996; previously, the Mayor was directly appointed by the President of <this country>.\nThe Greater <this city> conurbation, which also includes several <this city> Province districts, constitutes the fourth-most populous metropolitan area in the Americas, with a population of around 15.6 million. It is also the second largest city south of the Tropic of Capricorn. The quality of life in <this city> was ranked 91st in the world in 2018, being one of the best in Latin America. In 2012, it was the most visited city in South America, and the second-most visited city of Latin America.It is known for its preserved eclectic European architecture and rich cultural life. It is a multicultural city that is home to multiple ethnic and religious groups, contributing to its culture as well as to the dialect spoken in the city and in some other parts of the country. This is because since the 19th century, the city, and the country in general, has been a major recipient of millions of immigrants from all over the world, making it a melting pot where several ethnic groups live together. Thus, <this city> is considered one of the most diverse cities of the Americas. <this city> held the 1st FIBA World Championship in 1950 and 11th FIBA World Championship in 1990, the 1st Pan American Games in 1951, was the site of two venues in the 1978 FIFA World Cup and one in the 1982 FIVB Men's World Championship. Most recently, <this city> had a venue in the 2001 FIFA World Youth Championship and in the 2002 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship, hosted the 125th IOC Session in 2013, the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics and the 2018 G20 summit.\n\nEtymology\nIt is recorded under the Aragonese's archives that Catalan missionaries and Jesuits arriving in Cagliari (Sardinia) under the Crown of Aragon, after its capture from the Pisans in 1324 established their headquarters on top of a hill that overlooked the city. The hill was known to them as Bonaira (or Bonaria in Sardinian language), as it was free of the foul smell prevalent in the old city (the castle area), which is adjacent to swampland. During the Cagliari's siege, the Catalans built a sanctuary to the Virgin Mary on top of the hill. In 1335, King Alfonso the Gentle donated the church to the Mercedarians, who built an abbey that stands to this day. In the years after that, a story circulated, claiming that a statue of the Virgin Mary was retrieved from the sea after it miraculously helped to calm a storm in the Mediterranean Sea. The statue was placed in the abbey. Spanish sailors, especially Andalusians, venerated this image and frequently invoked the \"Fair Winds\" to aid them in their navigation and prevent shipwrecks. A sanctuary to the Virgin of Buen Ayre would be later erected in Seville.In the first foundation of <this city>, Spanish sailors arrived thankfully in the R\u00edo de la Plata by the blessings of the \"Santa Maria de los <this city>\", the \"Holy Virgin Mary of the Good Winds\" who was said to have given them the good winds to reach the coast of what is today the modern city of <this city>. Pedro de Mendoza called the city \"Holy Mary of the Fair Winds\", a name suggested by the chaplain of Mendoza's expedition \u2013 a devotee of the Virgin of Buen Ayre \u2013 after the Madonna of Bonaria from Sardinia (which is still to this day the patroness of the Mediterranean island). Mendoza's settlement soon came under attack by indigenous people, and was abandoned in 1541.For many years, the name was attributed to a Sancho del Campo, who is said to have exclaimed: How fair are the winds of this land!, as he arrived. But in 1882, after conducting extensive research in Spanish archives, Argentine merchant Eduardo Madero ultimately concluded that the name was indeed closely linked with the devotion of the sailors to Our Lady of Buen Ayre. A second (and permanent) settlement was established in 1580 by Juan de Garay, who sailed down the Paran\u00e1 River from Asunci\u00f3n (now the capital of Paraguay). Garay preserved the name originally chosen by Mendoza, calling the city Ciudad de la Sant\u00edsima Trinidad y Puerto de Santa Mar\u00eda del Buen Aire (\"City of the Most Holy Trinity and Port of Saint Mary of the Fair Winds\"). The short form that eventually became the city's name, \"<this city>\", became commonly used during the 17th century.The usual abbreviation for <this city> in Spanish is Bs.As. It is common as well to refer to it as \"B.A.\" or \"BA\". When referring specifically to the autonomous city, it is very common to colloquially call it \"Capital\" in Spanish. Since the autonomy obtained in 1994, it has been called \"CABA\" (per Ciudad Aut\u00f3noma de <this city>, Autonomous City of <this city>).\n\nHistory\nColonial times\nIn 1516, navigator and explorer Juan D\u00edaz de Sol\u00eds, navigating in the name of Spain, was the first European to reach the R\u00edo de la Plata. His expedition was cut short when he was killed during an attack by the native Charr\u00faa tribe in what is now Uruguay. The city of <this city> was first established as Ciudad de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora Santa Mar\u00eda del Buen Ayre (literally \"City of Our Lady Saint Mary of the Fair Winds\") after Our Lady of Bonaria (Patroness Saint of Sardinia) on 2 February 1536 by a Spanish expedition led by Pedro de Mendoza. The settlement founded by Mendoza was located in what is today the San Telmo district of <this city>, south of the city center.\nMore attacks by the indigenous people forced the settlers away, and in 1542, the site was thusly abandoned. A second (and permanent) settlement was established on 11 June 1580 by Juan de Garay, who arrived by sailing down the Paran\u00e1 River from Asunci\u00f3n (now the capital of Paraguay). He dubbed the settlement \"Sant\u00edsima Trinidad\" and its port became \"Puerto de Santa Mar\u00eda de los <this city>.\"From its earliest days, <this city> depended primarily on trade. During most of the 17th century, Spanish ships were menaced by pirates, so they developed a complex system where ships with military protection were dispatched to Central America in a convoy from Seville (the only port allowed to trade with the colonies) to Lima, Peru, and from it to the inner cities of the viceroyalty. Because of this, products took a very long time to arrive in <this city>, and the taxes generated by the transport made them prohibitive. This scheme frustrated the traders of <this city>, and a thriving informal yet accepted by the authorities contraband industry developed inside the colonies and with the Portuguese. This also instilled a deep resentment among porte\u00f1os towards the Spanish authorities.\nSensing these feelings, Charles III of Spain progressively eased the trade restrictions before finally declaring <this city> an open port in the late 18th century. The capture of Portobelo in Panama by British forces also fueled the need to foster commerce via the Atlantic route, to the detriment of Lima-based trade. One of his rulings was to split a region from the Viceroyalty of Per\u00fa and create instead the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata, with <this city> as the capital. However, Charles's placating actions did not have the desired effect, and the porte\u00f1os, some of them versed in the ideology of the French Revolution, instead became even more convinced of the need for independence from Spain.\n\nWar of Independence\nDuring the British invasions of the R\u00edo de la Plata, British forces attacked <this city> twice. In 1806 the British successfully invaded <this city>, but an army from Montevideo led by Santiago de Liniers defeated them. In the brief period of British rule, the viceroy Rafael Sobremonte managed to escape to C\u00f3rdoba and designated this city as capital. <this city> became the capital again after its recapture by Argentine forces, but Sobremonte could not resume his duties as viceroy. Santiago de Liniers, chosen as new viceroy, prepared the city against a possible new British attack and repelled a second invasion by Britain in 1807. The militarization generated in society changed the balance of power favorably for the criollos (in contrast to peninsulars), as well as the development of the Peninsular War in Spain.\nAn attempt by the peninsular merchant Mart\u00edn de \u00c1lzaga to remove Liniers and replace him with a Junta was defeated by the criollo armies. However, by 1810 it would be those same armies who would support a new revolutionary attempt, successfully removing the new viceroy Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros. This is known as the May Revolution, which is now celebrated as a national holiday. This event started the Argentine War of Independence, and many armies left <this city> to fight the diverse strongholds of royalist resistance, with varying levels of success. The government was held first by two Juntas of many members, then by two triumvirates, and finally by a unipersonal office, the Supreme Director. Formal independence from Spain was declared in 1816, at the Congress of Tucum\u00e1n. <this city> managed to endure the whole Spanish American wars of independence without falling again under royalist rule.\nHistorically, <this city> has been <this country>'s main venue of liberal, free-trading, and foreign ideas. In contrast, many of the provinces, especially those to the city's northwest, advocated a more nationalistic and Catholic approach to political and social issues. In fact, much of the internal tension in <this country>'s history, starting with the centralist-federalist conflicts of the 19th century, can be traced back to these contrasting views. In the months immediately following said \"May Revolution\", <this city> sent a number of military envoys to the provinces with the intention of obtaining their approval. Instead, the enterprise fueled tensions between the capital and the provinces; many of these missions ended in violent clashes.\nIn the 19th century the city was blockaded twice by naval forces: by the French from 1838 to 1840, and later by an Anglo-French expedition from 1845 to 1848. Both blockades failed to bring the Argentine government to the negotiating table, and the foreign powers eventually desisted from their demands.\n\n19th and 20th century\nDuring most of the 19th century, the political status of the city remained a sensitive subject. It was already the capital of <this city> Province, and between 1853 and 1860 it was the capital of the seceded State of <this city>. The issue was fought out more than once on the battlefield, until the matter was finally settled in 1880 when the city was federalized and became the seat of government, with its mayor appointed by the president. The Casa Rosada became the seat of the president.Health conditions in poor areas were appalling, with high rates of tuberculosis. Contemporaneous public health physicians and politicians typically blamed both the poor themselves and their ramshackle tenement houses (conventillos) for the spread of the dreaded disease. People ignored public-health campaigns to limit the spread of contagious diseases, such as the prohibition of spitting on the streets, the strict guidelines to care for infants and young children, and quarantines that separated families from ill loved ones.In addition to the wealth generated by customs duties and Argentine foreign trade in general, as well as the existence of fertile pampas, railroad development in the second half of the 19th century increased the economic power of <this city> as raw materials flowed into its factories. A leading destination for immigrants from Europe, particularly Italy and Spain, from 1880 to 1930, <this city> became a multicultural city that ranked itself alongside the major European capitals. During this time, the Col\u00f3n Theater became one of the world's top opera venues, and the city became the regional capital of radio, television, cinema, and theater. The city's main avenues were built during those years, and the dawn of the 20th century saw the construction of South America's tallest buildings and its first underground system. A second construction boom, from 1945 to 1980, reshaped downtown and much of the city.\n\n<this city> also attracted migrants from <this country>'s provinces and neighboring countries. Shanty towns (villas miseria) started growing around the city's industrial areas during the 1930s, leading to pervasive social problems and social contrasts with the largely upwardly-mobile <this city> population. These laborers became the political base of Peronism, which emerged in <this city> during the pivotal demonstration of 17 October 1945, at the Plaza de Mayo. Industrial workers of the Greater <this city> industrial belt have been Peronism's main support base ever since, and Plaza de Mayo became the site for demonstrations and many of the country's political events; on 16 June 1955, however, a splinter faction of the Navy bombed the Plaza de Mayo area, killing 364 civilians (see Bombing of Plaza de Mayo). This was the only time the city was attacked from the air, and the event was followed by a military uprising which deposed President Per\u00f3n, three months later (see Revoluci\u00f3n Libertadora).\nIn the 1970s the city suffered from the fighting between left-wing revolutionary movements (Montoneros, ERP and F.A.R.) and the right-wing paramilitary group Triple A, supported by Isabel Per\u00f3n, who became president of <this country> in 1974 after Juan Per\u00f3n's death.\nThe March 1976 coup, led by General Jorge Videla, only escalated this conflict; the \"Dirty War\" resulted in 30,000 desaparecidos (people kidnapped and killed by the military during the years of the junta). The silent marches of their mothers (Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo) are a well-known image of Argentines' suffering during those times. The dictatorship's appointed mayor, Osvaldo Cacciatore, also drew up plans for a network of freeways intended to relieve the city's acute traffic gridlock. The plan, however, called for a seemingly indiscriminate razing of residential areas and, though only three of the eight planned were put up at the time, they were mostly obtrusive raised freeways that continue to blight a number of formerly comfortable neighborhoods to this day.\n\nThe city was visited by Pope John Paul II twice, firstly in 1982 and again in 1987; on these occasions gathered some of the largest crowds in the city's history. The return of democracy in 1983 coincided with a cultural revival, and the 1990s saw an economic revival, particularly in the construction and financial sectors.\nOn 17 March 1992, a bomb exploded in the Israeli Embassy, killing 29 and injuring 242. Another explosion, on 18 July 1994, destroyed a building housing several Jewish organizations, killing 85 and injuring many more, these incidents marked the beginning of Middle Eastern terrorism to South America. Following a 1993 agreement, the Argentine Constitution was amended to give <this city> autonomy and rescinding, among other things, the president's right to appoint the city's mayor (as had been the case since 1880). On 30 June 1996, voters in <this city> chose their first elected mayor, Jefe de Gobierno.\n\n21st century\nIn 1996, following the 1994 reform of the Argentine Constitution, the city held its first mayoral elections under the new statutes, with the mayor's title formally changed to \"Head of Government\". The winner was Fernando de la R\u00faa, who would later become President of <this country> from 1999 to 2001.\nDe la R\u00faa's successor, An\u00edbal Ibarra, won two popular elections, but was impeached (and ultimately deposed on 6 March 2006) as a result of the fire at the Rep\u00fablica Cromagnon nightclub. In the meantime, Jorge Telerman, who had been the acting mayor, was invested with the office. In the 2007 elections, Mauricio Macri of the Republican Proposal (PRO) party won the second-round of voting over Daniel Filmus of the Frente para la Victoria (FPV) party, taking office on 9 December 2007. In 2011, the elections went to a second round with 60.96 percent of the vote for PRO, compared to 39.04 percent for FPV, thus ensuring Macri's reelection as mayor of the city with Mar\u00eda Eugenia Vidal as deputy mayor.PRO is established in the most affluent area of the city and in those over fifty years of age.The 2015 elections were the first to use an electronic voting system in the city, similar to the one used in Salta Province. In these elections held on 5 July 2015, Macri stepped down as mayor and pursue his presidential bid and Horacio Rodr\u00edguez Larreta took his place as the mayoral candidate for PRO. In the first round of voting, FPV's Mariano Recalde obtained 21.78% of the vote, while Mart\u00edn Lousteau of the ECO party obtained 25.59% and Larreta obtained 45.55%, meaning that the elections went to a second round since PRO was unable to secure the majority required for victory. The second round was held on 19 July 2015 and Larreta obtained 51.6% of the vote, followed closely by Lousteau with 48.4%, thus, PRO won the elections for a third term with Larreta as mayor and Diego Santilli as deputy. In these elections, PRO was stronger in wealthier northern <this city>, while ECO was stronger in the southern, poorer neighborhoods of the city.\n\nGeography\nThe city of <this city> lies in the pampa region, with the exception of some areas such as the <this city> Ecological Reserve, the Boca Juniors (football club)'s \"sports city\", Jorge Newbery Airport, the Puerto Madero neighborhood and the main port itself; these were all built on reclaimed land along the coasts of the Rio de la Plata (the world's widest river).The region was formerly crossed by different streams and lagoons, some of which were refilled and others tubed. Among the most important streams are the Maldonado, Vega, Medrano, Cilda\u00f1ez, and White. In 1908, as floods were damaging the city's infrastructure, many streams were channeled and rectified; furthermore, starting in 1919, most streams were enclosed. Most notably, the Maldonado was tubed in 1954; it currently runs below Juan B. Justo Avenue.\n\nParks\n<this city> has over 250 parks and green spaces, the largest concentration of which are on the city's eastern side in the neighborhoods of Puerto Madero, Recoleta, Palermo, and Belgrano. Some of the most important are:\n\nParque Tres de Febrero was designed by urbanist Jord\u00e1n Czeslaw Wysocki and architect Julio Dormal. The park was inaugurated on 11 November 1875. The subsequent dramatic economic growth of <this city> helped to lead to its transfer to the municipal domain in 1888, whereby French Argentine urbanist Carlos Thays was commissioned to expand and further beautify the park, between 1892 and 1912. Thays designed the Zoological Gardens, the Botanical Gardens, the adjoining Plaza Italia and the Rose Garden.\nBotanical Gardens, designed by French architect and landscape designer Carlos Thays, the garden was inaugurated on 7 September 1898. Thays and his family lived in an English style mansion, located within the gardens, between 1892 and 1898, when he served as director of parks and walks in the city. The mansion, built in 1881, is currently the main building of the complex.\n<this city> Japanese Gardens Is the largest of its type in the world, outside Japan. Completed in 1967, the gardens were inaugurated on the occasion of a State visit to <this country> by Crown Prince Akihito and Princess Michiko of Japan.\nPlaza de Mayo Since being the scene of May Revolution of 1810 that led to Argentinian independence, the plaza has been a hub of political life in <this country>.\nPlaza San Mart\u00edn is a park located in the city's neighborhood of Retiro. Situated at the northern end of pedestrianized Florida Street, the park is bounded by Libertador Ave. (N), Maip\u00fa St. (W), Santa Fe Avenue (S), and Leandro Alem Av. (E).\n\nClimate\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, <this city> has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) with four distinct seasons. As a result of maritime influences from the adjoining Atlantic Ocean, the climate is temperate with extreme temperatures being rare. Because the city is located in an area where the Pampero and Sudestada winds pass by, the weather is variable due to these contrasting air masses.\nSummers are hot and humid. The warmest month is January, with a daily average of 24.9 \u00b0C (76.8 \u00b0F). Heat waves are common during summers. However, most heat waves are of short duration (less than a week) and are followed by the passage of the cold, dry Pampero wind which brings violent and intense thunderstorms followed by cooler temperatures. The highest temperature ever recorded was 43.3 \u00b0C (110 \u00b0F) on 29 January 1957. In January 2022, a heatwave caused power grid failure in parts of <this city> metropolitan area affecting more than 700,000 households.Winters are cool with mild temperatures during the day and chilly nights. Highs during the season average 16.6 \u00b0C (61.9 \u00b0F) while lows average 8.3 \u00b0C (46.9 \u00b0F). Relative humidity averages in the upper 70s%, which means the city is noted for moderate-to-heavy fogs during autumn and winter. July is the coolest month, with an average temperature of 11.0 \u00b0C (51.8 \u00b0F). Cold spells originating from Antarctica occur almost every year, and can persist for several days. Occasionally, warm air masses from the north bring warmer temperatures. The lowest temperature ever recorded in central <this city> (<this city> Central Observatory) was \u22125.4 \u00b0C (22 \u00b0F) on 9 July 1918. Snow is very rare in the city: the last snowfall occurred on 9 July 2007 when, during the coldest winter in <this country> in almost 30 years, severe snowfalls and blizzards hit the country. It was the first major snowfall in the city in 89 years.Spring and autumn are characterized by changeable weather conditions. Cold air from the south can bring cooler temperatures while hot humid air from the north brings hot temperatures.The city receives 1,257.6 mm (50 in) of precipitation per year. Because of its geomorphology along with an inadequate drainage network, the city is highly vulnerable to flooding during periods of heavy rainfall.\n\nGovernment and politics\nGovernment structure\nSince the adoption of the city's Constitution in 1996, <this city> has counted with a democratically elected executive; Article 61 of the Constitution of the states that \"Suffrage is free, equal, secret, universal, compulsory and non-accumulative. Resident aliens enjoy this same right, with its corresponding obligations, on equal terms with Argentine citizens registered in the district, under the terms established by law.\" The executive power is vested on the Chief of Government (Spanish: Jefe de Gobierno), who is elected alongside a Deputy Chief of Government. In analogous fashion to the Vice President of <this country>, the Deputy Chief of Government presides over the city's legislative body, the City Legislature.\nThe Chief of Government and the Legislature are both elected for four-year terms; half of the Legislature's members are renewed every two years. Elections use the D'Hondt method of proportional representation. The judicial branch comprises the Supreme Court of Justice (Tribunal Superior de Justicia), the Council of Magistracy (Consejo de la Magistratura), the Public Ministry, and other city courts.\nLegally, the city has less autonomy than the Provinces. In June 1996, shortly before the city's first Executive elections were held, the Argentine National Congress issued the National Law 24.588 (known as Ley Cafiero, after the Senator who advanced the project) by which the authority over the 25,000-strong Argentine Federal Police and the responsibility over the federal institutions residing at the city (e.g., National Supreme Court of Justice buildings) would not be transferred from the National Government to the Autonomous City Government until a new consensus could be reached at the National Congress. Furthermore, it declared that the Port of <this city>, along with some other places, would remain under constituted federal authorities. As of 2011, the deployment of the Metropolitan Police of <this city> is ongoing.Beginning in 2007, the city has embarked on a new decentralization scheme, creating new Communes (comunas) which are to be managed by elected committees of seven members each. <this city> is represented in the Argentine Senate by three senators (as of 2017, Federico Pinedo, Marta Varela and Pino Solanas). The people of <this city> also elect 25 national deputies to the Argentine Chamber of Deputies.\n\nLaw enforcement\nThe Guardia Urbana de <this city> (<this city> Urban Guard) was a specialized civilian force of the city of <this city>, <this country>, that used to deal with different urban conflicts with the objective of developing actions of prevention, dissuasion and mediation, promoting effective behaviors that guarantee the security and the integrity of public order and social coexistence. The unit continuously assisted the personnel of the Argentine Federal Police, especially in emergency situations, events of massive concurrence, and protection of tourist establishments. Urban Guard officials did not carry any weapons in the performing of their duties. Their basic tools were a HT radio transmitter and a whistle. As of March 2008, the Guardia Urbana was removed.\nThe <this city> Metropolitan Police was the police force under the authority of the Autonomous City of <this city>. The force was created in 2010 and was composed of 1,850 officers. In 2016, the <this city> Metropolitan Police and part of the Argentine Federal Police were merged to create the new <this city> City Police force. The <this city> City Police force began operations on 1 January 2017. Security in the city is now the responsibility of the <this city> City Police. The police is headed by the Chief of Police who is appointed by the head of the executive branch of the city of <this city>. Geographically, the force is divided into 56 stations throughout the city. All police station employees are civilians. The <this city> City Police force is composed of over 25,000 officers.\n\nDemographics\nThe population in 1825 was over 81,000 people.\n\nCensus data\nIn the census of 2010 there were 2,891,082 people residing in the city. The population of Greater <this city> was 13,147,638 according to 2010 census data. The population density in <this city> proper was 13,680 inhabitants per square kilometer (35,400 inhabitants/sq mi), but only about 2,400/km2 (6,200/sq mi) in the suburbs.<this city>' population has hovered around 3 million since 1947, due to low birth rates and a slow migration to the suburbs. However, the surrounding districts have expanded over fivefold (to around 10 million) since then.The 2001 census showed a relatively aged population: with 17% under the age of fifteen and 22% over sixty, the people of <this city> have an age structure similar to those in most European cities. They are older than Argentines as a whole (of whom 28% were under 15, and 14% over 60).Two-thirds of the city's residents live in apartment buildings and 30% in single-family homes; 4% live in sub-standard housing. Measured in terms of income, the city's poverty rate was 8.4% in 2007 and, including the metro area, 20.6%. Other studies estimate that 4 million people in the metropolitan <this city> area live in poverty.The city's resident labor force of 1.2 million in 2001 was mostly employed in the services sector, particularly social services (25%), commerce and tourism (20%) and business and financial services (17%); despite the city's role as <this country>'s capital, public administration employed only 6%. Manufacturing still employed 10%.\n\nDistricts\nThe city is divided into barrios (neighborhoods) for administrative purposes, a division originally based on Catholic parroquias (parishes). A common expression is that of the Cien barrios porte\u00f1os (\"One hundred porte\u00f1o neighborhoods\"), referring to a composition made popular in the 1940s by tango singer Alberto Castillo; however, <this city> only consists of 48 official barrios. There are several subdivisions of these districts, some with a long history and others that are the product of a real estate invention. A notable example is Palermo \u2013 the city's largest district \u2013 which has been subdivided into various barrios, including Palermo Soho, Palermo Hollywood, Las Ca\u00f1itas and Palermo viejo, among others. A newer scheme has divided the city into 15 comunas (communes).\n\nPopulation origin\nThe majority of porte\u00f1os have European origins, mostly from the Andalusian, Galician, Asturian, and Basque regions of Spain, as well as the Italian regions of Calabria, Liguria, Piedmont, Lombardy, Sicily and Campania. Unrestricted waves of European immigrants to <this country> starting in the mid-19th century significantly increased the country's population, even causing the number of porte\u00f1os to triple between 1887 and 1915 from 500,000 to 1.5 million.\nOther significant European origins include French, Portuguese, German, Irish, Norwegian, Polish, Swedish, Greek, Czech, Albanian, Croatian, Slovenian, Dutch, Russian, Serbian, English, Scottish, Slovak, Hungarian and Bulgarian. In the 1980s and 1990s, there was a small wave of immigration from Romania and Ukraine. There is a minority of criollo citizens, dating back to the Spanish colonial days. The Criollo and Spanish-Indigenous (mestizo) population in the city has increased mostly as a result of immigration from the inner northern provinces and from other countries such as neighboring Bolivia, Paraguay, Chile and Peru, since the second half of the 20th century.The Jewish community in Greater <this city> numbers around 250,000 and is the largest in the country. The city is also eighth largest in the world in terms of Jewish population. Most are of Northern, Western, Central, and Eastern European Ashkenazi origin, primarily Swedish, Dutch, Polish, German, and Russian Jews, with a significant Sephardic minority, mostly made up of Syrian Jews and Lebanese Jews. Important Lebanese, Georgian, Syrian and Armenian communities have had a significant presence in commerce and civic life since the beginning of the 20th century.\nMost East Asian immigration in <this city> comes from China. Chinese immigration is the fourth largest in <this country>, with the vast majority of them living in <this city> and its metropolitan area. In the 1980s, most of them were from Taiwan, but since the 1990s the majority of Chinese immigrants come from the Mainland Chinese province of Fukien (Fujian). The mainland Chinese who came from Fukien mainly installed supermarkets throughout the city and the suburbs; these supermarkets are so common that, in average, there is one every two and a half blocks and are simply referred to as el chino (\"the Chinese\"). Japanese immigrants are mostly from the Okinawa Prefecture. They started the dry cleaning business in <this country>, an activity that is considered idiosyncratic to the Japanese immigrants in <this city>. Korean Immigration occurred after the division of Korea; they mainly settled in Flores and Once.In the 2010 census [INDEC], 2.1% of the population or 61,876 persons declared to be Indigenous or first-generation descendants of Indigenous people in <this city> (not including the 24 adjacent Partidos that make up Greater <this city>). Amongst the 61,876 persons who are of indigenous origin, 15.9% are Quechua people, 15.9% are Guaran\u00ed, 15.5% are Aymara and 11% are Mapuche. Within the 24 adjacent Partidos, 186,640 persons or 1.9% of the total population declared themselves to be Indigenous. Amongst the 186,640 persons who are of indigenous origin, 21.2% are Guaran\u00ed, 19% are Toba, 11.3% are Mapuche, 10.5% are Quechua and 7.6% are Diaguita.In the city, 15,764 people identified themselves as Afro-Argentine in the 2010 Census.\n\nUrban problems\nVillas miseria are a type of slum whose size ranges from small groups of precarious houses to large communities with thousands of residents. In rural areas, the houses in the villas miseria might be made of mud and wood. Villas miseria are found around and inside the large cities of <this city>, Rosario, C\u00f3rdoba and Mendoza, among others.\n<this city> has below 2 m2 (22 sq ft) of green space per person, which is 90% less than New York, 85% less than Madrid and 80% less than Paris. The World Health Organization (WHO), in its concern for public health, produced a document stating that every city should have a minimum of 9 m2 (97 sq ft) of green space per person; an optimal amount of space per person would range from 10 to 15 m2 (161 sq ft).\n\nLanguage\n<this city>' dialect of Spanish, which is known as Rioplatense Spanish, is distinguished by its use of voseo, ye\u00edsmo, and aspiration of s in various contexts. It is heavily influenced by the dialects of Spanish spoken in Andalusia and Murcia, and shares its features with that of other cities like Rosario and Montevideo, Uruguay. In the early 20th century, <this country> absorbed millions of immigrants, many of them Italians, who spoke mostly in their local dialects (mainly Neapolitan, Sicilian and Genoese). Their adoption of Spanish was gradual, creating a pidgin of Italian dialects and Spanish that was called cocoliche. Its usage declined around the 1950s. A phonetic study conducted by the Laboratory for Sensory Investigations of CONICET and the University of Toronto showed that the prosody of porte\u00f1o is closer to the Neapolitan language of Italy than to any other spoken language. Many Spanish immigrants were from Galicia, and Spaniards are still generically referred to in <this country> as gallegos (Galicians). Galician language, cuisine and culture had a major presence in the city for most of the 20th century. In recent years, descendants of Galician immigrants have led a mini-boom in Celtic music (which also highlighted the Welsh traditions of Patagonia). Yiddish was commonly heard in <this city>, especially in the Balvanera garment district and in Villa Crespo until the 1960s. Most of the newer immigrants learn Spanish quickly and assimilate into city life.\nThe Lunfardo argot originated within the prison population, and in time spread to all porte\u00f1os. Lunfardo uses words from Italian dialects, from Brazilian Portuguese, from African and Caribbean languages and even from English. Lunfardo employs humorous tricks such as inverting the syllables within a word (vesre). Today, Lunfardo is mostly heard in tango lyrics; the slang of the younger generations has been evolving away from it. <this city> was also the first city to host a Mundo Lingo event on 7 July 2011, which have been after replicated in up to 15 cities in 13 countries.\n\nReligion\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century, <this city> was the second-largest Catholic city in the world after Paris. Christianity is still the most prevalently practiced religion in <this city> (~71.4%), a 2019 CONICET survey on religious beliefs and attitudes found that the inhabitants of the <this city> Metropolitan Area (\u00c1rea Metropolitana de <this city>, AMBA) were 56.4% Catholic, 26.2% non-religious and 15% Evangelical; making it the region of the country with the highest proportion of irreligious people. A previous CONICET survey from 2008 had found that 69.1% were Catholic, 18% \"indifferent\", 9.1% Evangelical, 1.4% Jehovah's Witnesses or Mormons and 2.3% adherents to other religions. The comparison between both surveys reveals that the <this city> Metropolitan Area is the region in which the decline of Catholicism was most pronounced during the last decade.<this city> is also home to the largest Jewish community in Latin America and the second largest in the Western Hemisphere after the United States. The Jewish community of <this city> has historically been characterized by its high level of assimilation, organization and influence in the cultural history of the city.<this city> is the seat of a Roman Catholic metropolitan archbishop (the Catholic primate of <this country>), currently Archbishop Mario Poli. His predecessor, Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio, was elected to the Papacy as Pope Francis on 13 March 2013. There are Protestant, Orthodox, Eastern Catholic, Buddhist and various other religious minorities as well.\n\nEducation\nPrimary education comprises grades 1\u20137. Most primary schools in the city still adhere to the traditional seven-year primary school, but kids can do grades 1\u20136 if their high school lasts 6 years, such as ORT <this country>. Secondary education in <this country> is called Polimodal (having multiple modes) since it allows the student to choose their orientation. Polimodal is usually 3 years of schooling, although some schools have a fourth year. Before entering the first year of polimodal, students choose an orientation from the following five specializations. Some high schools depend on the University of <this city>, and these require an admission course when students are taking the last year of high school. These high schools are ILSE, CNBA, Escuela Superior de Comercio Carlos Pellegrini and Escuela de Educaci\u00f3n T\u00e9cnica Profesional en Producci\u00f3n Agropecuaria y Agroalimentaria (School of Professional Technique Education in Agricultural and Agrifood Production). The last two do have a specific orientation. In December 2006 the Chamber of Deputies of the Argentine Congress passed a new National Education Law restoring the old system of primary followed by secondary education, making secondary education obligatory and a right, and increasing the length of compulsory education to 13 years. The government vowed to put the law in effect gradually, starting in 2007.There are many public universities in <this country>, as well as a number of private universities. The University of <this city>, one of the top learning institutions in South America, has produced five Nobel Prize winners and provides taxpayer-funded education for students from all around the globe. <this city> is a major center for psychoanalysis, particularly the Lacanian school. <this city> is home to several private universities of different quality, such as: Universidad <this country> de la Empresa, <this city> Institute of Technology, CEMA University, Favaloro University, Pontifical Catholic University of <this country>, University of Belgrano, University of Palermo, University of Salvador, Universidad Abierta Interamericana, Universidad <this country> John F. Kennedy, Universidad de Ciencias Empresariales y Sociales, Universidad del Museo Social Argentino, Universidad Austral, Universidad CAECE and Torcuato di Tella University.\n\nEconomy\n<this city> is the financial, industrial, and commercial hub of <this country>. The economy in the city proper alone, measured by Gross Geographic Product (adjusted for purchasing power), totaled US$102.7 billion (US$34,200 per capita) in 2020 and amounts to nearly a quarter of <this country>'s as a whole. Metro <this city>, according to one well-quoted study, constitutes the 13th largest economy among the world's cities in 2005. The <this city> Human Development Index (0.889 in 2019) is likewise high by international standards.The city's services sector is diversified and well-developed by international standards, and accounts for 76 percent of its economy (compared to 59% for all of <this country>'s). Advertising, in particular, plays a prominent role in the export of services at home and abroad. However, the financial and real estate services sector is the largest and contributes to 31 percent of the city's economy. Finance (about a third of this) in <this city> is especially important to <this country>'s banking system, accounting for nearly half the nation's bank deposits and lending. Nearly 300 hotels and another 300 hostels and bed & breakfasts are licensed for tourism, and nearly half the rooms available were in four-star establishments or higher.Manufacturing is, nevertheless, still prominent in the city's economy (16 percent) and, concentrated mainly in the southern part of the city. It benefits as much from high local purchasing power and a large local supply of skilled labor as it does from its relationship to massive agriculture and industry just outside the city limits. Construction activity in <this city> has historically been among the most accurate indicators of national economic fortunes, and since 2006 around 3 million square meters (32\u00d710^6 sq ft) of construction has been authorized annually. Meat, dairy, grain, tobacco, wool and leather products are processed or manufactured in the <this city> metro area. Other leading industries are automobile manufacturing, oil refining, metalworking, machine-building, and the production of textiles, chemicals, clothing and beverages.\nThe city's budget, per Mayor Macri's 2011 proposal, included US$6 billion in revenues and US$6.3 billion in expenditures. The city relies on local income and capital gains taxes for 61 percent of its revenues, while federal revenue sharing contributes 11 percent, property taxes, 9 percent, and vehicle taxes, 6 percent. Other revenues include user fees, fines, and gambling duties. The city devotes 26 percent of its budget to education, 22 percent for health, 17 percent for public services and infrastructure, 16 percent for social welfare and culture, 12 percent in administrative costs and 4 percent for law enforcement. <this city> maintains low debt levels and its service requires less than 3 percent of the budget.\n\nTourism\nAccording to the World Travel & Tourism Council, tourism has been growing in the Argentine capital since 2002. In a survey by the travel and tourism publication Travel + Leisure Magazine in 2008, visitors voted <this city> the second most desirable city to visit after Florence, Italy. In 2008, an estimated 2.5 million visitors visited the city. <this city> is an international hub of highly active and diverse nightlife with bars, dance bars and nightclubs staying open well past midnight.Visitors have many options for travel such as going to a tango show, an estancia in the Province of <this city>, or enjoying the traditional asado. New tourist circuits have recently evolved, devoted to Argentines such as Carlos Gardel, Eva Per\u00f3n or Jorge Luis Borges. Before 2011, due to the Argentine peso's favorable exchange rate, its shopping centers such as Alto Palermo, Paseo Alcorta, Patio Bullrich, Abasto de <this city> and Galer\u00edas Pac\u00edfico were frequently visited by tourists. Nowadays, the exchange rate has hampered tourism and shopping in particular. In fact, notable consumer brands such as Burberry and Louis Vuitton have abandoned the country due to the exchange rate and import restrictions. The city also plays host to musical festivals, some of the largest of which are Quilmes Rock, Creamfields BA, Ultra Music Festival (<this city>), and the <this city> Jazz Festival.\n\nThe most popular tourist sites are found in the historic core of the city, specifically, in the Montserrat and San Telmo neighborhoods. <this city> was conceived around the Plaza de Mayo, the colony's administrative center. To the east of the square is the Casa Rosada, the official seat of the executive branch of the government of <this country>. To the north, the Catedral Metropolitana which has stood in the same location since colonial times, and the Banco de la Naci\u00f3n <this country> building, a parcel of land originally owned by Juan de Garay. Other important colonial institutions were Cabildo, to the west, which was renovated during the construction of Avenida de Mayo and Julio A. Roca. To the south is the Congreso de la Naci\u00f3n (National Congress), which currently houses the Academia Nacional de la Historia (National Academy of History). Lastly, to the northwest, is City Hall.\n\n<this city> has become a recipient of LGBT tourism, due to the existence of some gay-friendly sites and the legalization of same-sex marriage on 15 July 2010, making it the first country in Latin America, the second in the Americas, and the tenth in the world to do so. Its Gender Identity Law, passed in 2012, made <this country> the \"only country that allows people to change their gender identities without facing barriers such as hormone therapy, surgery or psychiatric diagnosis that labels them as having an abnormality\". In 2015, the World Health Organization cited <this country> as an exemplary country for providing transgender rights. Despite these legal advances, however, homophobia continues to be a hotly contested social issue in the city and the country.<this city> has various types of accommodation ranging from luxurious five star hotels in the city center to budget hotels located in suburban neighborhoods. Nonetheless, the city's transportation system allows easy and inexpensive access to the city. There were, as of February 2008, 23 five-star, 61 four-star, 59 three-star and 87 two or one-star hotels, as well as 25 boutique hotels and 39 apart-hotels; another 298 hostels, bed & breakfasts, vacation rentals and other non-hotel establishments were registered in the city. In all, nearly 27,000 rooms were available for tourism in <this city>, of which about 12,000 belonged to four-star, five-star, or boutique hotels. Establishments of a higher category typically enjoy the city's highest occupation rates. The majority of the hotels are located in the central part of the city, in close proximity to most main tourist attractions.\n\nTransportation\nAccording to data released by Moovit in July 2017, the average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in <this city>, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 79 min. 23% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 14 min, while 20 percent of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 8.9 km, while 21% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\nRoads\n<this city> is based on a rectangular grid pattern, save for natural barriers or the relatively rare developments explicitly designed otherwise (most notably, the Parque Chas neighborhood). The rectangular grid provides for 110-meter (361 ft)-long square blocks named manzanas . Pedestrian zones in the central business district such as Florida Street are partially car-free and always bustling, access provided by bus and the Underground (subte) Line C. <this city>, for the most part, is a very walkable city and the majority of residents in <this city> use public transport.\nTwo diagonal avenues alleviate traffic and provide better access to Plaza de Mayo and the city center in general; most avenues running into and out of it are one-way and feature six or more lanes, with computer-controlled green waves to speed up traffic outside of peak times. The city's principal avenues include the 140-meter (459 ft)-wide July 9 Avenue, the over 35-kilometer (22 mi)-long Rivadavia Avenue, and Corrientes Avenue, the main thoroughfare of culture and entertainment.\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, the construction of the General Paz Avenue beltway that surrounds the city along its border with <this city> Province, and the freeways leading to the new international airport and to the northern suburbs, heralded a new era for <this city> traffic. Encouraged by pro-automaker policies that were pursued towards the end of the Per\u00f3n (1955) and Frondizi administrations (1958\u201362) in particular, auto sales nationally grew from an average of 30,000 during the 1920\u201357 era to around 250,000 in the 1970s and over 600,000 in 2008. Today, over 1.8 million vehicles (nearly one-fifth of <this country>'s total) are registered in <this city>.Toll motorways opened in the late 1970s by mayor Osvaldo Cacciatore, now used by over a million vehicles daily, provide convenient access to the city center. Cacciatore likewise had financial district streets (roughly 1 square kilometer (0.39 sq mi) in area) closed to private cars during daytime. Most major avenues are, however, gridlocked at peak hours. Following the economic mini-boom of the 1990s, record numbers started commuting by car and congestion increased, as did the time-honored Argentine custom of taking weekends off in the countryside.\n\nAirports\nThe Ministro Pistarini International Airport, commonly known as Ezeiza Airport, is located in the suburb of Ezeiza, in <this city> Province, approximately 22 km south of the city. This airport handles most international air traffic to and from <this country> as well as some domestic flights.\nThe Aeroparque Jorge Newbery airport, located in the Palermo district of the city next to the riverbank, is only within the city limits and serves primarily domestic traffic within <this country> and some regional flights to neighboring South American countries.\nOther minor airports near the city are El Palomar Airport, which is located 18 km west of the city and handles some scheduled domestic flights to a number of destinations in <this country>, and the smaller San Fernando Airport which serves only general aviation.\n\nUrban rail\nThe <this city> Underground (locally known as subte, from \"subterr\u00e1neo\" meaning underground or subway), is a high-yield system providing access to various parts of the city. Opened in 1913, it is the oldest underground system in the Southern Hemisphere and oldest in the Spanish-speaking world. The system has six underground lines and one overground line, named by letters (A to E, and H) and there are 100 stations, and 58.8 km (37 mi) of route, including the Premetro line. An expansion program is underway to extend existing lines into the outer neighborhoods and add a new north\u2013south line. Route length is expected to reach 89 km (55 mi) by 2011.\nLine A is the oldest one (service opened to public in 1913) and stations kept the \"belle-\u00e9poque\" decoration, while the original rolling stock from 1913, affectionately known as Las Brujas were retired from the line in 2013. Daily ridership on weekdays is 1.7 million and on the increase. Fares remain relatively cheap, although the city government raised fares by over 125% in January 2012. A single journey, with unlimited interchanges between lines, costs AR$42, which is roughly US$0.23 as of January 2023.The most recent expansions to the network were the addition of numerous stations to the network in 2013: San Jos\u00e9 de Flores and San Pedrito to Line A, Echeverr\u00eda and Juan Manuel de Rosas to Line B and Hospitales to Line H. Current works include the completion of Line H northwards and addition of three new stations to Line E in the city center. The construction of Line F is due to commence in 2015, while two other lines are planned for construction in the future.\nThe <this city> commuter rail system has seven lines: Belgrano Norte; Belgrano Sur; Roca; San Mart\u00edn; Sarmiento; Mitre; and Urquiza. The <this city> commuter network system is very extensive: every day more than 1.3 million people commute to the Argentine capital. These suburban trains operate between 4 am and 1 am. The <this city> commuter rail network also connects the city with long-distance rail services to Rosario and C\u00f3rdoba, among other metropolitan areas. The city center is home to four principal terminals for both long-distance and local passenger services: Constitucion, Retiro, Federico Lacroze and Once. In addition, <this city> station serves as a minor terminus.\n\nCommuter rail in the city is mostly operated by the state-owned Trenes Argentinos, though the Urquiza Line and Belgrano Norte Line are operated by private companies Metrov\u00edas and Ferrov\u00edas respectively. All services had been operated by Ferrocarriles Argentinos until the company's privatization in 1993, and were then operated by a series of private companies until the lines were put back under state control following a series of high-profile accidents.Since 2013, there has been a series of large investments on the network, with all lines (with the exception of the Urquiza Line) receiving new rolling stock, along with widespread infrastructure improvements, track replacement, electrification work, refurbishments of stations and building entirely new stations. Similarly, almost all level crossings have been replaced by underpasses and overpasses in the city, with plans to replace all of them in the near future. One of the most major projects under way is the electrification of the remaining segments of the Roca Line \u2013 the most widely used in the network \u2013 and also moving the entire section of the Sarmiento Line which runs through the heart of the city's underground to allow for better frequencies on the line and reduce congestion above ground.There are also three other major projects on the table. The first would elevate a large segment of the San Mart\u00edn Line which runs through the city center and electrify the line, while the second would see the electrification and extension of the Belgrano Sur Line to Constitucion station in the city center. If these two projects are completed, then the Belgrano Norte Line would be the only diesel line to run through the city. The third and most ambitious is to build a series of tunnels between three of the city's railway terminals with a large underground central station underneath the Obelisk, connecting all the commuter railway lines in a network dubbed the Red de Expresos Regionales.<this city> had an extensive street railway (tram) system with over 857 km (533 mi) of track, which was dismantled during the 1960s after the advent of bus transportation, but surface rail transport has made a small comeback in some parts of the city. The PreMetro or Line E2 is a 7.4 km (4.6 mi) light rail line that connects with Underground Line E at Plaza de los Virreyes station and runs to General Savio and Centro C\u00edvico. It is operated by Metrov\u00edas. The official inauguration took place on 27 August 1987. A 2-meter (7 ft)-long modern tramway, the Tranv\u00eda del Este, opened in 2007 in the Puerto Madero district, using two tramcars on temporary loan. However, plans to extend the line and acquire a fleet of trams did not come to fruition, and declining patronage led to the line's closure in October 2012. A heritage streetcar maintained by tram fans operates on weekends, near the Primera Junta line A Underground station in the neighborhood of Caballito.\n\nCycling\nIn December 2010, the city government launched a bicycle sharing program with bicycles free for hire by users upon registration. Located in mostly central areas, there are 31 rental stations throughout the city providing over 850 bicycles to be picked up and dropped off at any station within an hour. As of 2013, the city has constructed 110 km (68.35 mi) of protected bicycle lanes and has plans to construct another 100 km (62.14 mi). In 2015, the stations were automated and the service became 24 hours through use of a smart card or mobile phone application.\n\nBuses\nThere are over 150 city bus lines called Colectivos, each one managed by an individual company. These compete with each other and attract exceptionally high use with virtually no public financial support. Their frequency makes them equal to the underground systems of other cities, but buses cover a far wider area than the underground system. Colectivos in <this city> do not have a fixed timetable, but run from four to several per hour, depending on the bus line and time of the day. With inexpensive tickets and extensive routes, usually no further than four blocks from commuters' residences, the colectivo is the most popular mode of transport around the city.<this city> has recently opened a bus rapid transit system, the Metrobus. The system uses modular median stations that serve both directions of travel, which enable pre-paid, multiple-door, level boarding. The first line, opened on 31 May 2011, runs across the Juan B. Justo Ave has 21 stations. The system now has 4 lines with 113 stations on its 43.5 km (27.0 mi) network, while numerous other lines are under construction and planned.\n\nPort\nThe port of <this city> is one of the busiest in South America, as navigable rivers by way of the Rio de la Plata connect the port to northeastern <this country>, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay. As a result, it serves as the distribution hub for said vast area of the South American continent. The Port of <this city> handles over 11,000,000 metric tons (11,000,000 long tons; 12,000,000 short tons) annually, and Dock Sud, just south of the city proper, handles another 17,000,000 metric tons (17,000,000 long tons; 19,000,000 short tons). Tax collection related to the port has caused many political problems in the past, including a conflict in 2008 that led to protests and a strike in the agricultural sector after the government raised export tariffs.\n\nFerries\n<this city> is also served by a ferry system operated by the company Buquebus that connects the port of <this city> with the main cities of Uruguay, (Colonia del Sacramento, Montevideo and Punta del Este). More than 2.2 million people per year travel between <this country> and Uruguay with Buquebus. One of these ships is a catamaran, which can reach a top speed of about 80 km/h (50 mph).\n\nTaxis\nA fleet of 40,000 black-and-yellow taxis ply the streets at all hours. Some taxi drivers may try to take advantage of tourists., but radio-link companies provide reliable and safe service; many such companies provide incentives for frequent users. Low-fare limo services, known as remises, are also popular. though currently giving way to ridesharing companies like Uber or Cabify, whose legal status has been the cause of much dispute with the city government\n\nCulture\nAs <this city> is strongly influenced by European culture, the city is sometimes referred to as the \"Paris of South America\". With its scores of theaters and productions, the city has the busiest live theater industry in South America. In fact, every weekend, there are about 300 active theaters with plays, a number that places the city as 1st worldwide, more than either London, New York or Paris, cultural Meccas in themselves. The number of cultural festivals with more than 10 sites and 5 years of existence also places the city as 2nd worldwide, after Edinburgh. The Centro Cultural Kirchner (Kirchner Cultural Center), located in <this city>, is the largest cultural center of Latin America, and the third worldwide.<this city> is the home of the Teatro Col\u00f3n, an internationally rated opera house. There are several symphony orchestras and choral societies. The city has numerous museums related to arts and crafts, history, fine arts, modern arts, decorative arts, popular arts, sacred art, theater and popular music, as well as the preserved homes of noted art collectors, writers, composers and artists. The city is home to hundreds of bookstores, public libraries and cultural associations (it is sometimes called \"the city of books\"), as well as the largest concentration of active theaters in Latin America. It has a zoo and botanical garden, a large number of landscaped parks and squares, as well as churches and places of worship of many denominations, many of which are architecturally noteworthy.The city has been a member of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network after it was named \"City of Design\" in 2005.\n\nPorte\u00f1o identity\nThe identity of porte\u00f1os has a rich and complex history, and has been the subject of much analysis and scrutiny. The great European immigration wave of the early 20th century was integral to \"the growing primacy of <this city> and the accompanying urban identity\", and established the division between urban and rural <this country> more deeply. Immigrants \"brought new traditions and cultural markers to the city,\" which were \"then reimagined in the porte\u00f1o context, with new layers of meanings because of the new location.\" The heads of state's attempt to populate the country and reframe the national identity resulted in the concentration of immigrants in the city and its suburbs, who generated a culture that is a \"product of their conflicts of integration, their difficulties to live and their communication puzzles.\" In response to the immigration wave, during the 1920s and 1930s a nationalist trend within the Argentine intellectual elite glorified the gaucho figure as an exemplary archetype of Argentine culture; its synthesis with the European traditions conformed the new urban identity of <this city>. The complexity of <this city>' integration and identity formation issues increased when immigrants realized that their European culture could help them gain a greater social status. As the rural population moved to the industrialized city from the 1930s onwards, they reaffirmed their European roots, adopting endogamy and founding private schools, newspapers in foreign languages, and associations that promoted adherence to their countries of origin.Porte\u00f1os are generally characterized as night owls, cultured, talkative, uninhibited, sensitive, nostalgic, observant and arrogant. Argentines outside <this city> often stereotype its inhabitants as egotist people, a feature that people from the Americas and westerners in general commonly attribute to the entire Argentine population and use as the subject of numerous jokes. Writing for BBC Mundo Cristina P\u00e9rez felt that \"the idea of the [Argentines'] vastly developed ego finds strong evidence in lunfardo dictionaries,\" in words such as \"engrupido\" (meaning \"vain\" or \"conceited\") and \"compadrito\" (meaning both \"brave\" and \"braggart\"), the latter being an archetypal figure of tango. Paradoxically, porte\u00f1os are also described as highly self-critical, something that has been called \"the other side of the ego coin.\" Writers consider the existence of these behaviors the consequence of the European immigration and prosperity that the city experienced during the early 20th century, which generated a feeling of superiority in parts of the population.\n\nArt\n<this city> has a thriving arts culture, with \"a huge inventory of museums, ranging from obscure to world-class.\" The barrios of Palermo and Recoleta are the city's traditional bastions in the diffusion of art, although in recent years there has been a tendency of appearance of exhibition venues in other districts such as Puerto Madero or La Boca; renowned venues include MALBA, the National Museum of Fine Arts, Fundaci\u00f3n Proa, Faena Arts Center, and the Usina del Arte. Other popular institutions are the <this city> Museum of Modern Art, the Quinquela Mart\u00edn Museum, the Evita Museum, the Fern\u00e1ndez Blanco Museum, the Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez Museum, and the Palais de Glace, among others. A traditional event that occurs once a year is La Noche de los Museos (\"Night of the Museums\"), when the city's museums, universities, and artistic spaces open their doors for free until early morning; it usually takes place in November.The first major artistic movements in <this country> coincided with the first signs of political liberty in the country, such as the 1913 sanction of the secret ballot and universal male suffrage, the first president to be popularly elected (1916), and the cultural revolution that involved the University Reform of 1918. In this context, in which there continued to be influence from the Paris School (Modigliani, Chagall, Soutine, Klee), three main groups arose.\n<this city> has been the birthplace of several artists and movements of national and international relevance, and has become a central motif in Argentine artistic production, especially since the 20th century.\nExamples include: the Paris Group \u2013 so named for being influenced by the School of Paris \u2013 constituted by Antonio Berni, Aquiles Badi, Lino Enea Spilimbergo, Raquel Forner and Alfredo Bigatti, among others; and the La Boca artists \u2013 including Benito Quinquela Mart\u00edn and Alfredo Lazzari, among others \u2013 who mostly came from Italy or were of Italian descent, and usually painted scenes from working-class port neighborhoods. During the 1960s, the Torcuato di Tella Institute \u2013 located in Florida Street \u2013 became a leading local center for pop art, performance art, installation art, conceptual art, and experimental theater; this generation of artists included Marta Minuj\u00edn, Dalila Puzzovio, David Lamelas, Clorindo Testa and Diana Dowek.\n<this city> has also become a prominent center of contemporary street art; its welcoming attitude has made it one of the world's top capitals of such expression. The city's turbulent modern political history has \"bred an intense sense of expression in porte\u00f1os\", and urban art has been used to depict these stories and as a means of protest. However, not all of its street art concerns politics, it is also used as a symbol of democracy and freedom of expression. Murals and graffiti are so common that they are considered \"an everyday occurrence,\" and have become part of the urban landscape of barrios such as Palermo, Villa Urquiza, Coghlan and San Telmo. This has to do with the legality of such activities \u2014provided that the building owner has consented\u2014, and the receptiveness of local authorities, who even subsidize various works. The abundance of places for urban artists to create their work, and the relatively lax rules for street art, have attracted international artists such as Blu, Jef A\u00e9rosol, Aryz, ROA, and Ron English. Guided tours to see murals and graffiti around the city have been growing steadily.\n\nLiterature\n<this city> has long been considered an intellectual and literary capital of Latin America and the Spanish-speaking world. Despite its short urban history, <this city> has an abundant literary production; its mythical-literary network \"has grown at the same rate at which the streets of the city earned its shores to the pampas and buildings stretched its shadow on the curb.\" During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, culture boomed along with the economy and the city emerged as a literary capital and the seat of South America's most powerful publishing industry, and \"even if the economic path grew rocky, ordinary Argentines embraced and stuck to the habit of reading.\" By the 1930s, <this city> was the undisputed literary capital of the Spanish-speaking world, with Victoria Ocampo founding the highly influential Sur magazine\u2014which dominated Spanish-language literature for thirty years\u2014 and the arrival of prominent Spanish writers and editors who were escaping the civil war.<this city> is one of the most prolific book publishers in Latin America and has more bookstores per capita than any other major city in the world. <this city> has at least 734 bookstores\u2014roughly 25 bookshops for every 100,000 inhabitants\u2014far above other world cities like London, Paris, Madrid, Moscow and New York. The city also has a thriving market for secondhand books, ranking third in terms of secondhand bookshops per inhabitant, most of them congregated along Avenida Corrientes. <this city>' book market has been described as \"catholic in taste, immune to fads or fashion\", with \"wide and varied demand.\" The popularity of reading among porte\u00f1os has been variously linked to the wave of mass immigration in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and to the city's \"obsession\" with psychoanalysis.The <this city> International Book Fair has been a major event in the city since the first fair in 1975, having been described as \"perhaps the most important and largest annual literary event in the Spanish-speaking world,\" and \"the most important cultural event in Latin America\". In its 2019 edition, the Book Fair was attended by 1.8 million people.<this city> was designated as the World Book Capital for the year 2011 by UNESCO.\n\nMusic\nAccording to the Harvard Dictionary of Music, \"<this country> has one of the richest art music traditions and perhaps the most active contemporary musical life\" in South America. <this city> boasts of several professional orchestras, including the Argentine National Symphony Orchestra, the Ensamble Musical de <this city> and the Camerata Bariloche; as well as various conservatories that offer professional music education, like the Conservatorio Nacional Superior de M\u00fasica. As a result of the growth and commercial prosperity of the city in the late 18th century, theater became a vital force in Argentine musical life, offering Italian and French operas and Spanish zarzuelas. Italian music was very influential during the 19th century and the early 20th century, in part because of immigration, but operas and salon music were also composed by Argentines, including Francisco Hargreaves and Juan Guti\u00e9rrez. A nationalist trend that drew from Argentine traditions, literature and folk music was an important force during the 19th century, including composers Alberto Williams, Juli\u00e1n Aguirre, Arturo Berutti and Felipe Boero. In the 1930s, composers such as Juan Carlos Paz and Alberto Ginastera \"began to espouse a cosmopolitan and modernist style, influenced by twelve-tone techniques and serialism\"; while avant-garde music thrived by the 1960s, with the Rockefeller Foundation financing the Centro Interamericano de Altos Estudios Musicales, which brought internationally famous composers to work and teach in <this city>, also establishing an electronic music studio.\nThe R\u00edo de la Plata is known for being the birthplace of tango, which is considered an emblem of <this city>. The city considers itself the Tango World Capital, and as such hosts many related events, the most important being an annual festival and world tournament. The most important exponent of the genre is Carlos Gardel, followed by An\u00edbal Troilo; other important composers include Alfredo Gobbi, \u00c1stor Piazzolla, Osvaldo Pugliese, Mariano Mores, Juan D'Arienzo and Juan Carlos Cobi\u00e1n. Tango music experienced a period of splendor during the 1940s, while in the 1960s and 1970s nuevo tango appeared, incorporating elements of classical and jazz music. A contemporary trend is neotango (also known as electrotango), with exponents such as Bajofondo and Gotan Project. On 30 September 2009, UNESCO's Intergovernmental Committee of Intangible Heritage declared tango part of the world's cultural heritage, making <this country> eligible to receive financial assistance in safeguarding tango for future generations.The city hosts several music festivals every year. A popular genre is electronic dance music, with festivals including Creamfields BA, SAMC, Moonpark, and a local edition of Ultra Music Festival. Other well-known events include the <this city> Jazz Festival, Personal Fest, Quilmes Rock and Pepsi Music. Some music festivals are held in Greater <this city>, like Lollapalooza, which takes place at the Hip\u00f3dromo de San Isidro in San Isidro.\n\nCinema\nArgentine cinema history began in <this city> with the first film exhibition on 18 July 1896 at the Teatro Ode\u00f3n. With his 1897 film, La bandera <this country>, Eug\u00e8ne Py became one of the first filmmakers of the country; the film features a waving Argentine flag located at Plaza de Mayo. In the early 20th century, the first movie theaters of the country opened in <this city>, and newsreels appeared, most notably El Viaje de Campos Salles a <this city>. The real industry emerged with the advent of sound films, the first one being Mu\u00f1equitas porte\u00f1as (1931). The newly founded <this country> Sono Film released \u00a1Tango! in 1933, the first integral sound production in the country. During the 1930s and the 1940s (commonly referred as the \"Golden Age\" of Argentine cinema), many films revolved around the city of <this city> and tango culture, reflected in titles such as La vida es un tango, El alma del bandone\u00f3n, Adi\u00f3s <this city>, El Cantor de <this city> and <this city> canta. Argentine films were exported across Latin America, specially Libertad Lamarque's melodramas, and the comedies of Luis Sandrini and Nin\u00ed Marshall. The popularity of local cinema in the Spanish-speaking world played a key role in the massification of tango music. Carlos Gardel, an iconic figure of tango and <this city>, became an international star by starring in several films during that era.\nIn response to large studio productions, the \"Generation of the 60s\" appeared, a group of filmmakers that produced the first modernist films in <this country> during the early years of that decade. These included Manuel Ant\u00edn, Lautaro Mur\u00faa and Ren\u00e9 Mugica, among others.\nDuring the second half of the decade, films of social protest were presented in clandestine exhibitions, the work of Grupo Cine Liberaci\u00f3n and Grupo Cine de la Base, who advocated what they called \"Third Cinema\". At that time, the country was under a military dictatorship after the coup d'\u00e9tat known as Argentine Revolution. One of the most notable films of this movement is La hora de los hornos (1968) by Fernando Solanas. During the period of democracy between 1973 and 1975, the local cinema experienced critical and commercial success, with titles including Juan Moreira (1973), La Patagonia rebelde (1974), La Raulito (1975), and La tregua (1974) \u2013 which became the first Argentine film nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. However, because of censorship and a new military government, Argentine cinema stalled until the return of democracy in the 1980s. This generation \u2013 known as \"Argentine Cinema in Liberty and Democracy\" \u2013 were mostly young or postponed filmmakers, and gained international notoriety. Camila (1984) by Mar\u00eda Luisa Bemberg was nominated for the Best Foreign Film at the Academy Awards, and Luis Puenzo's La historia oficial (1985) was the first Argentine film to receive the award.\nLocated in <this city> is the Pablo Ducr\u00f3s Hicken Museum of Cinema, the only one in the country dedicated to Argentine cinema and a pioneer of its kind in Latin America. Every year, the city hosts the <this city> International Festival of Independent Cinema (BAFICI), which, in its 2015 edition, featured 412 films from 37 countries, and an attendance of 380 thousand people. <this city> also hosts various other festivals and film cycles, like the <this city> Rojo Sangre, devoted to horror.\n\nMedia\n<this city> is home to five Argentine television networks: America, Television P\u00fablica <this country>, El Nueve, Telefe, and El Trece. Four of them are located in <this city>, and the studios of America is located in La Plata.\n\nFashion\n<this city>' inhabitants have been historically characterized as \"fashion-conscious\". National designers display their collections annually at the <this city> Fashion Week (BAFWEEK) and related events. Inevitably being a season behind, it fails to receive much international attention. Nevertheless, the city remains an important regional fashion capital. According to Global Language Monitor, as of 2017 the city is the 20th leading fashion capital in the world, ranking second in Latin America after Rio de Janeiro. In 2005, <this city> was appointed as the first UNESCO City of Design, and received this title once again in 2007. Since 2015, the <this city> International Fashion Film Festival <this city> (BAIFFF) takes place, sponsored by the city and Mercedes-Benz. The government of the city also organizes La Ciudad de Moda (\"The City of Fashion\"), an annual event that serves as a platform for emerging creators and attempts to boost the sector by providing management tools.The fashionable neighborhood of Palermo, particularly the area known as Soho, is where the latest fashion and design trends are presented. The \"sub-barrio\" of Palermo Viejo is also a popular port of call for fashion in the city. An increasing number of young, independent designers are also setting up their own shops in Bohemian San Telmo, known for its wide variety of markets and antique shops. Recoleta, on the other hand, is the epicenter of branches of exclusive and upscale fashion houses. In particular, Avenida Alvear is home to the most exclusive representatives of haute couture in the city.\n\nArchitecture\n<this city> architecture is characterized by its eclectic nature, with elements resembling Paris and Madrid. There is a mix, due to immigration, of Colonial, Art Deco, Art Nouveau, Neo-Gothic, and French Bourbon styles. Italian and French influences increased after the declaration of independence at the beginning of the 19th century, although the academic style persisted until the first decades of the 20th century. Attempts at renovation took place during the second half of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, when European influences penetrated into the country, reflected by several buildings of <this city> such as the Iglesia Santa Felicitas by Ernesto Bunge; the Palace of Justice, the National Congress, all of them by Vittorio Meano, and the Teatro Col\u00f3n, by Francesco Tamburini and Vittorio Meano. The simplicity of the Rioplatense baroque style can be clearly seen in <this city> through the works of Italian architects such as Andr\u00e9 Blanqui and Antonio Masella, in the churches of San Ignacio, Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar, the Cathedral and the Cabildo.\n\nIn 1912, the Basilica del Santisimo Sacramento was opened to the public; its construction was funded by the generous donation of Argentine philanthropist Mercedes Castellanos de Anchorena, a member of <this country>'s most prominent family. The church is an excellent example of French neo-classicism. With extremely high-grade decorations in its interior, the magnificent Mutin-Cavaill\u00e9 coll organ (the biggest ever installed in an Argentine church with more than four thousand tubes and four manuals) presided the nave. The altar is full of marble, and was the biggest ever built in South America at that time.In 1919, the construction of Palacio Barolo began. This was South America's tallest building at the time and was the first Argentine skyscraper built with concrete (1919\u20131923). The building was equipped with 9 elevators, plus a twenty-meter-high (65 ft) lobby hall with paintings in the ceiling and Latin phrases embossed in golden bronze letters. A 300,000-candela beacon was installed at the top (110 m), making the building visible even from Uruguay. In 2009, the Barolo Palace went under an exhaustive restoration, and the beacon was made operational again.\nIn 1936, the 120-meter-tall (395 ft) Kavanagh Building was inaugurated. The building, with its 12 elevators (provided by Otis) and the world's first central air conditioning system (provided by the North American company Carrier), is still an architectural landmark in <this city>.The architecture of the second half of the 19th century continued to reproduce French neoclassic models, such as the headquarters of the Banco de la Naci\u00f3n <this country> built by Alejandro Bustillo, and the Museo Hispanoamericano de <this city> of Mart\u00edn Noel. However, since the 1930s, the influence of Le Corbusier and European rationalism consolidated in a group of young architects from the University of Tucum\u00e1n, among whom Amancio Williams stands out. The construction of skyscrapers proliferated in <this city> until the 1950s. Newer modern high-technology buildings by Argentine architects in the last years of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st include the Le Parc Tower by Mario \u00c1lvarez, the Torre Fortabat by S\u00e1nchez El\u00eda, and the Repsol-YPF Tower by C\u00e9sar Pelli.\n\nTheaters\n<this city> has over 280 theaters, more than any other city in the world.
