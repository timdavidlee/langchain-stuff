  "wiki_text": "<this city> ( MEW-nik; German: M\u00fcnchen [\u02c8m\u028fn\u00e7n\u0329] (listen); Bavarian: Minga [\u02c8m\u026a\u014b(\u02d0)\u0250] (listen)) is the capital and most populous city of the Free State of Bavaria. With a population of 1,578,132 inhabitants as of 31 May 2022, it is the third-largest city in <this country>, after Berlin and Hamburg, and thus the largest which does not constitute its own state, as well as the 11th-largest city in the European Union. The city's metropolitan region is home to about 6 million people.Straddling the banks of the River Isar north of the Alps, <this city> is the seat of the Bavarian administrative region of Upper Bavaria, while being the most densely populated municipality in <this country> with 4,500 people per km2. <this city> is the second-largest city in the Bavarian dialect area, after the Austrian capital of Vienna.\nThe city was first mentioned in 1158. Catholic <this city> strongly resisted the Reformation and was a political point of divergence during the resulting Thirty Years' War, but remained physically untouched despite an occupation by the Protestant Swedes. Once Bavaria was established as Kingdom of Bavaria in 1806, <this city> became a major European centre of arts, architecture, culture and science. In 1918, during the German Revolution of 1918\u201319, the ruling House of Wittelsbach, which had governed Bavaria since 1180, was forced to abdicate in <this city> and a short-lived Bavarian Soviet Republic was declared. In the 1920s, <this city> became home to several political factions, among them the Nazi Party. After the Nazis' rise to power, <this city> was declared their \"Capital of the Movement\". The city was heavily bombed during World War II, but has restored most of its old town. After the end of postwar American occupation in 1949, there was a great increase in population and economic power during the years of Wirtschaftswunder. The city hosted the 1972 Summer Olympics.\nToday, <this city> is a global centre of science, technology, finance, innovation, business, and tourism. <this city> enjoys a very high standard and quality of living, reaching first in <this country> and third worldwide according to the 2018 Mercer survey, and being rated the world's most liveable city by the Monocle's Quality of Life Survey 2018. <this city> is consistently ranked as one of the most expensive cities in <this country> in terms of real estate prices and rental costs.In 2021, 28.8 percent of <this city>'s residents were foreigners, and another 17.7 percent were German citizens with a migration background from a foreign country. <this city>'s economy is based on high tech, automobiles, and the service sector, as well as IT, biotechnology, engineering, and electronics. It has one of the strongest economies of any German city and the lowest unemployment rate of all cities in <this country> with more than 1 million inhabitants. The city houses many multinational companies, such as BMW, Siemens, MAN SE, Allianz SE and <this city> Re. In addition, <this city> is home to two research universities, and a multitude of scientific institutions. <this city>'s numerous architectural and cultural attractions, sports events, exhibitions and its annual Oktoberfest, the world's largest Volksfest, attract considerable tourism.\n\nHistory\nEtymology\n<this city> was a tiny 8th century friar settlement, which was named zu den <this city>en (to the Monks). The Old High German <this city>e served as basis for the modern German city name M\u00fcnchen.\n\nPrehistory\nThe river Isar was a prehistoric trade route and in the Bronze Age <this city> was among the largest raft ports in Europe. Bronze Age settlements, up to 4000 years old, have been discovered. Evidence of Celt settlements from the Iron Age have been discovered in areas around Ramersdorf-Perlach.\n\nRoman period\nThe ancient Roman road Via Julia, which connected Augsburg and Salzburg, crossed over the Isar river south of <this city>, at the towns of Baierbrunn and Gauting. A Roman settlement north-east of <this city> was excavated in the neighborhood of Denning.\n\nPost-Roman settlements\nStarting in the 6th century, the Baiuvarii populated the area around what is now modern <this city>, such as in Johanneskirchen, Feldmoching, Bogenhausen and Pasing. The first known Christian church was built ca. 815 in Fr\u00f6ttmanning.\n\nOrigin of medieval town\nThe first medieval bridges across the river Isar were located in current city areas of <this city> and Landshut. The Duke of Saxony and Bavaria Henry the Lion founded the town of <this city> in his territory to control the salt trade, after having burned down the town of F\u00f6hring and its bridges over the river Isar. Historians date this event at about 1158. The layout of <this city> city, with five city gates and market place, resembled that of H\u00f6xter.Henry built a new toll bridge, customs house and a coin market closer to his home somewhat upstream at a settlement around the area of modern old town <this city>. This new toll bridge most likely crossed the Isar where the Museuminsel and the modern Ludwigsbr\u00fccke is now located.Otto of Freising protested to his nephew, Emperor Frederick Barbarosa (d. 1190). However, on 14 June 1158, in Augsburg, the conflict was settled in favor of Duke Henry. The Augsburg Arbitration mentions the name of the location in dispute as forum apud <this city>en. Although Bishop Otto had lost his bridge, the arbiters ordered Duke Henry to pay a third of his income to the Bishop in Freising as compensation.The 14. June 1158 is considered the official founding day of the city of <this city>. Archaeological excavations at Marienhof Square (near Marienplatz) in advance of the expansion of the S-Bahn (subway) in 2012 discovered shards of vessels from the 11th century, which prove again that the settlement of <this city> must be older than the Augsburg Arbitration of 1158. The old St. Peter's Church near Marienplatz is also believed to predate the founding date of the town.In 1175, <this city> received city status and fortification. In 1180, after Henry the Lion's fall from grace with Emperor Frederick Barbarosa, including his trial and exile, Otto I Wittelsbach became Duke of Bavaria, and <this city> was handed to the Bishop of Freising. In 1240, <this city> was transferred to Otto II Wittelsbach and in 1255, when the Duchy of Bavaria was split in two, <this city> became the ducal residence of Upper Bavaria.\nDuke Louis IV, a native of <this city>, was elected German king in 1314 and crowned as Holy Roman Emperor in 1328. He strengthened the city's position by granting it the salt monopoly, thus assuring it of additional income.\nOn 13 February 1327, a large fire broke out in <this city> that lasted two days and destroyed about a third of the town.In 1349, the Black Death ravaged <this city> and Bavaria.In the 15th century, <this city> underwent a revival of Gothic arts: the Old Town Hall was enlarged, and <this city>'s largest Gothic church \u2013 the Frauenkirche \u2013 now a cathedral, was constructed in only 20 years, starting in 1468.\n\nCapital of reunited Bavaria\nWhen Bavaria was reunited in 1506 after a brief war against the Duchy of Landshut, <this city> became its capital. The arts and politics became increasingly influenced by the court. The Renaissance movement beset <this city> and the Bavarian branch of the House of Wittelsbach under the Duke of Bavaria Albrecht V bolstered their prestige by conjuring up a lineage that reached back to Classical antiquity. In 1568 Albrecht V built the Antiquarium to house the Wittelsbach collection of Greek and Roman antiquities in the <this city> Residenz. Albrecht V appointed the composer Orlando di Lasso as director of the court orchestra and tempted numerous Italian musicians to work at the <this city> court, establishing <this city> as a hub for late Renaissance music. During the rule of Duke William V <this city> began to be called the \"German Rome\" and William V began presenting Emperor Charlemagne as ancestor of the Wittelsbach dynasty.Duke William V further cemented the Wittelsbach rule by commissioning the Jesuit Michaelskirche. He had the sermons of his Jesuit court preacher Jeremias Drexel translated from Latin into German and published them to a greater audience. William V was addressed with the epithet \"the Pious\" and like his contemporary Wittelsbach dukes promoted himself as \"father of the land\" (Landesvater), encouraged pilgrimages and Marian devotions. William V had the Hofbr\u00e4uhaus built in 1589. It would become the prototype for beer halls across <this city>. After World War II the Residenze, the Hofbr\u00e4uhaus, the Frauenkirche, and the Peterskirche were reconstructed to look exactly as they did before the Nazi Party seized power in 1933.\nThe Catholic League was founded in <this city> in 1609. In 1623, during the Thirty Years' War (1618\u20131648), <this city> became an electoral residence when Maximilian I, Duke of Bavaria was invested with the electoral dignity, but in 1632 the city was occupied by Gustav II Adolph of Sweden.In 1634 Swedish and Spanish troops advanced on <this city>. Maximilian I published a plague ordinance to halt an epidemic escalation. The bubonic plague nevertheless ravaged <this city> and the surrounding countryside in 1634 and 1635. During the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648) troops again converged on <this city> in 1647 and precautions were taken, so as to avoid another epidemic.Under the regency of the Bavarian electors, <this city> was an important centre of Baroque life, but also had to suffer under Habsburg occupations in 1704 and 1742. When Maximilian III Joseph, Elector of Bavaria died in 1745, the succession empowered the Palatinate branch within the House of Wittelsbach.In 1777 Bavarian lands were inherited to Karl Theodor, Duke in Bavaria. The new Duke was disliked by the citizens of <this city> for his supposedly enlightened ideas. In 1785 Karl Theodor invited Count Rumford Benjamin Thompson to take up residency in <this city> and implement stringent social reforms. The poor were forced to live in newly built workhouses. The Bavarian army was restructured, with common soldiers receiving better food and reassurances that they would be treated humanely by officers. <this city> was the largest German city to loose fortification in the 1790s. In 1791 Karl Theodor and Count Rumford started to demolish <this city>'s fortifications. After 1793 <this city>'s citizens, including house servants, carpenters, butchers, merchants, and court officials, seized the opportunity, building new houses, stalls, and sheds outside the city walls.After making an alliance with Napoleonic France, the city became the capital of the new Kingdom of Bavaria in 1806 with Elector Maximillian Joseph becoming its first King. The state parliament (the Landtag) and the new archdiocese of <this city> and Freising were also located in the city.The establishment of Bavarian state sovereignty profoundly affected <this city>. <this city> became the center of a modernizing kingdom, and one of the king's first acts was the secularization of Bavaria. He had dissolved all monasteries in 1802 and once crowned, Max Joseph I generated state revenues by selling off church lands. While many monasteries were reestablished, Max Joseph I succeeded in controlling the right to brew beer (Brauchrecht). The king handed the brewing monopoly to <this city>'s wealthiest brewers, who in turn paid substantial taxs on their beer production. In 1807 the king abolished all ordinances that limited the number of apprentices and journeymen a brewery could employ. <this city>'s population had swelled and <this city> brewers were now free to employ as many workers as they needed to meet the demand. In October 1810 a beer festival was held on the meadows just outside <this city> to commemorate the wedding of the crown price and princess Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen. The parades in regional dress (Tracht) represented the diversity of the kingdom. The fields are now part of the Theresienwiese and the celebrations developed into <this city>'s annual Oktoberfest.The Bavarian state proceeded to take control over the beer market, by regulating all taxes on beer in 1806 and 1811. Brewers and the beer taverns (Wirtsh\u00e4user) were taxed, and the state also controlled the quality of beer while limiting the competition among breweries. In 1831 the king's government introduced a cost-of-living allowance on beer for lower-ranking civil servants and soldiers. Soldiers stationed in <this city> were granted a daily allowance for beer in the early 1840s. By the 1850s beer had become essential staple food for <this city>'s working and lower classes. Since the Middle Ages beer had been regarded as nutritious liquid bread (flie\u00dfendes Brot) in Bavaria. But <this city> suffered from poor water sanitation and as early as the 1700s beer came to be regarded as the fifth element. Beer was essential in maintaining public health in <this city> and in the mid 1840s <this city> police estimated that at least 40,000 residents relied primarily on beer for their nutrition.\nIn 1832 Peter von Hess painted the Greek War of Independence at the order of Ludwig I of Bavaria. Ludwig I had the K\u00f6nigsplatz built in neoclassicism as a matter of ideological choice. Leo von Klenze supervised the construction of a Propylaia between 1854 and 1862.During the early to mid-19th century, the old fortified city walls of <this city> were largely demolished due to population expansion. The first <this city> railway station was built in 1839, with a line going to Augsburg in the west. By 1849 a newer <this city> Central Train Station (M\u00fcnchen Hauptbahnhof) was completed, with a line going to Landshut and Regensburg in the north. In 1825 Ludwig I had ascended to the throne and commissioned leading architects such as Leo von Klenze to design a series of public museums in neoclassical style. The grand building projects of Ludwig I got <this city> the endearment \"Isar-Athen\" and \"Monaco di Bavaria\". Between 1856 and 1861 the court gardener Carl von Effner landscaped the banks of river Isar and established the Maximilian Gardens. In 1857 the construction of the Maximilianeum was started.By the time Ludwig II became king in 1864, he remained mostly aloof from his capital and focused more on his fanciful castles in the Bavarian countryside, which is why he is known the world over as the 'fairytale king'. Ludwig II tried to lure Richard Wagner to <this city>, but his plans for an opera house were declined by the city council. Ludwig II nevertheless generated a windfall for <this city>'s craft and construction industries. In 1876 <this city> hosted the first German Art and Industry Exhibition, which showcased the northern Neo-Renaissance fashion that came to be the German Empire's predominant style. <this city> based artists put on the German National Applied Arts Exhibition in 1888, showcasing Baroque Revival architecture and Rococo Revival designs.\nIn 1900 Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen moved to <this city>, he was appointed as professor of Physics. In 1901 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics.The Prince Regent Luitpold's reign from 1886 till 1912 was marked by tremendous artistic and cultural activity in <this city>. At the dawn of the 20th century <this city> was an epicenter for the Jugendstil movement, combining a liberal magazine culture with progressive industrial design and architecture. The German art movement took its name from the <this city> magazine Die Jugend (The Youth). Prominent <this city> Jugendstil artists include Hans Eduard von Berlepsch-Valendas, Otto Eckmann, Margarethe von Brauchitsch, August Endell, Hermann Obrist, Wilhelm von Debschitz, and Richard Riemerschmid. In 1905 two large department stores opened in <this city>, the Kaufhaus Oberpollinger and the Warenhaus Hermann Tietz, both had been designed by the architect Max Littmann. In 1911 the expressionist group Der Blaue Reiter was established in <this city>. Its founding members include Gabriele M\u00fcnter.\n\nWorld War I to World War II\nFollowing the outbreak of World War I in 1914, life in <this city> became very difficult, as the Allied blockade of <this country> led to food and fuel shortages. During French air raids in 1916, three bombs fell on <this city>.In 1916, the 'Bayerische Motoren Werke' (BMW) produced its first aircraft engine in <this city>. The stock cooperation BMW AG was founded in 1918, with Camillo Castiglioni owning one third of the share capital. In 1922 BMW relocated its headquarters to a factory in <this city>.After World War I, the city was at the centre of substantial political unrest. In November 1918, on the eve of the German revolution, Ludwig III of Bavaria and his family fled the city. After the murder of the first republican premier of Bavaria Kurt Eisner in February 1919 by Anton Graf von Arco auf Valley, the Bavarian Soviet Republic was proclaimed. The November 1918 revolution ended the reign of the Wittelsbach in Bavaria. In Mein Kampf Adolf Hitler described his political activism in <this city> after November 1918 as the \"Beginning of My Political Activity\". Hitler called the shortlived Bavarian Soviet Republic \"the rule of the Jews\". In 1919 Bavaria Film was founded and in the 1920s <this city> offered film makers an alternative to <this country>'s largest film studio in Babelsberg.\nIn 1923 Gustav von Kahr was appointed Bavarian prime minister and immediately planned for the expulsion of all Jews that did not hold German citizenship. Chief of Police Ernst P\u00f6hner and Wilhelm Frick openly indulged in antisemitism, while Bavarian judges praised people on the political right as patriotic for their crimes and handed down mild sentences. In 1923, Adolf Hitler and his supporters, who were concentrated in <this city>, staged the Beer Hall Putsch, an attempt to overthrow the Weimar Republic and seize power. The revolt failed, resulting in Hitler's arrest and the temporary crippling of the Nazi Party (NSDAP).<this city> was chosen as capital for the Free State of Bavaria and acquired increased responsibility for administering the city itself and the surrounding districts. Offices needed to be built for bureaucracy, so a 12-story office building was erected in the southern part of the historic city centre in the late 1920s.<this city> again became important to the Nazis when they took power in <this country> in 1933. The party created its first concentration camp at Dachau, 16 km (9.9 mi) north-west of the city. Because of its importance to the rise of National Socialism, <this city> was referred to as the Hauptstadt der Bewegung (\"Capital of the Movement\").The NSDAP headquarters and the documentation apparatus for controlling all aspects of life were located in <this city>. Nazi organizations, such as the National Socialist Women's League and the Gestapo, had their offices along Brienner Stra\u00dfe and around the K\u00f6nigsplatz. The party acquired 68 buildings in the area and many F\u00fchrerbauten (\"F\u00fchrer buildings\") were built to reflect a new aesthetic of power. Construction work for the F\u00fchrerbau and the party headquarters (known as the Brown House) started in September 1933. The Haus der Kunst (House of German Art) was the first building to be commissioned by Hitler. The architect Paul Troost was asked to start work shortly after the Nazis had seized power because \"the most German of all German cities\" was left with no exhibition building when in 1931 the Glass Palace was destroyed in an arson. The Red Terror that supposedly preceded Nazi control in <this city>, was detailed in Nazi publications, seminal accounts are that of Rudolf Schricker Rotmord \u00fcber M\u00fcnchen published in 1934, and Die Blutchronik des Marxismus in Deutschland by Adolf Ehrt and Hans Roden.In 1930 Feinkost K\u00e4fer was founded in <this city>, the K\u00e4fer catering business is now a world leading party service.The city was the site where the 1938 <this city> Agreement signed between the United Kingdom and the Third French Republic with Nazi <this country> as part of the Franco-British policy of appeasement. The British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain assented to the German annexation of Czechoslovakia's Sudetenland in the hopes of satisfying Hitler's territorial expansion.The <this city>-Riem Airport was completed in October 1939.On November 8, 1939, shortly after the Second World War had begun, Georg Elser planted a bomb in the B\u00fcrgerbr\u00e4ukeller in <this city> in an attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler, who held a political party speech. Hitler, however, had left the building minutes before the bomb went off. By mid 1942 the majority of Jews living in <this city> and the suburbs had been deported.<this city> was the base of the White Rose, a student resistance movement. The group had distributed leaflets in several cities and following the 1943 Battle of Stalingrad members of the group stenciled slogans such as \"Down with Hitler\" and \"Hitler the Mass Murderer\" on public buildings in <this city>. The core members were arrested and executed after Sophie Scholl and her brother Hans Scholl were caught distributing leaflets on <this city> University campus calling upon the youth to rise against Hitler.The city was heavily damaged by the bombing of <this city> in World War II, with 71 air raids over five years. US troops liberated <this city> on April 30, 1945.\n\nPostwar\nIn the aftermath of World War II, <this country> and Japan were subject to US Military occupation. After US occupation <this city> was completely rebuilt following a meticulous plan, which preserved its pre-war street grid, bar a few exceptions owing to then modern traffic concepts. In 1957, <this city>'s population surpassed one million. The city continued to play a highly significant role in the German economy, politics and culture, giving rise to its nickname Heimliche Hauptstadt (\"secret capital\") in the decades after World War II. In <this city>, the Bayerischer Rundfunk began its first television broadcast in 1954.The Free State of Bavaria used the arms industry as kernel for its high tech development policy. Since 1963, <this city> has been hosting the <this city> Security Conference, held annually in the Hotel Bayerischer Hof. <this city> also became known on the political level due to the strong influence of Bavarian politician Franz Josef Strauss from the 1960s to the 1980s. The <this city> Airport, which commenced operations in 1992, was named in his honor.In the early 1960s Dieter Kunzelmann was expelled from the Situationist International and founded an influential group called Subversive Aktion in <this city>. Kunzelmann was also active in West Berlin, and became known for using situationist avant-garde as a cover for political violence.\n<this city> hosted the 1972 Summer Olympics. After winning the bid in 1966 the Mayor of <this city> Hans-Jochen Vogel accelerated the construction of the U-Bahn subway and the S-Bahn metropolitan commuter railway. In May 1967 the construction work began for a new U-Bahn line connecting the city with the Olympic Park. The Olympic Park subway station was built near the BMW Headquarters and the line was completed May 1972, three months before the opening of the 1972 Summer Olympics. Shortly before the opening ceremony, <this city> also inaugurated a sizable pedestrian priority zone between Karlsplatz and Marienplatz. In 1970 the <this city> city council released funds so that the iconic gothic facade and Glockenspiel of the New City Hall (Neues Rathaus) could be restored.During 1972 Summer Olympics 11 Israeli athletes were murdered by Palestinian terrorists in the <this city> massacre, when gunmen from the Palestinian \"Black September\" group took hostage members of the Israeli Olympic team.The most deadly militant attack the Federal Republic of <this country> has ever witnessed, was the Oktoberfest bombing. The attack was eventually blamed on militant Neo-Nazism.\n<this city> and its urban sprawl emerged as leading German high tech region during the 1980s and 1990s. The urban economy of <this city> became characterized by a dynamic labour market, low unemployment, a growing service economy and high per capita income. <this city> is home of the famous Nockherberg Strong Beer Festival during the Lenten fasting period (usually in March). Its origins go back to the 17th/18th century, but has become popular when the festivities were first televised in the 1980s. The fest includes comical speeches and a mini-musical in which numerous German politicians are parodied by look-alike actors.In 2007 the ecological restoration of the river Isar in the urban area of <this city> was awarded the Water Development Prize by the German Association for Water, Wastewater and Waste (known as DWA in German). The renaturation of the Isar allows for the near natural development of the river bed and is part of <this city>'s flood protection. About 20 percent of buildings in <this city> now have a green roof, the <this city> city council has been encouraging better stormwater management since the 1990s with regulations and subsidies.On the fifth anniversary of the 2011 Norway attacks an active shooter perpetrated hate crime. The 2016 <this city> shooting aimed at killing people of Turkish and Arab descent.<this city> was one of the host cities for UEFA Euro 2020, which was delayed for a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic in <this country>, and is planned to be a host city for UEFA Euro 2024.\n\nGeography\nTopography\n<this city> lies on the elevated plains of Upper Bavaria, about 50 km (31 mi) north of the northern edge of the Alps, at an altitude of about 520 m (1,706 ft) ASL. The local rivers are the Isar and the W\u00fcrm. <this city> is situated in the Northern Alpine Foreland. The northern part of this sandy plateau includes a highly fertile flint area which is no longer affected by the folding processes found in the Alps, while the southern part is covered with morainic hills. Between these are fields of fluvio-glacial out-wash, such as around <this city>. Wherever these deposits get thinner, the ground water can permeate the gravel surface and flood the area, leading to marshes as in the north of <this city>.\n\nClimate\n<this city> is located in close proximity of the Alps. <this city> has an oceanic climate (Cfb) under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification. Annual variation in temperature can be significant, as there is no substantial bodies of water nearby. The winter in <this city> can be cold and overcast, while some <this city> winters can be marked by snow and frost. In <this city>, January is the coldest month, night time temperature can be as low as \u22125 Celsius and even lower. In <this city> the summer is usually pleasantly warm, with temperatures averaging 23 Celsius. But, <this city> summers can average up to 28 Celsius, topping 30 Celsius on average. During extreme heat summers in <this city>, rain and thunderstorms are normal.<this city> is subject to active convective seasons and on occasion damaging events. The Alpine thunderstorm system moves along the mountain range, or detaches, heading east-north-east over the foothills of the Alps.At <this city>'s official weather stations, the highest and lowest temperatures ever measured are 37.5 \u00b0C (100 \u00b0F), on 27 July 1983 in Trudering-Riem, and \u221231.6 \u00b0C (\u221224.9 \u00b0F), on 12 February 1929 in the Botanic Garden of the city.\n\nClimate change\nIn <this city>, the general trend of global warming with a rise of medium yearly temperatures of about 1 \u00b0C in <this country> over the last 120 years can be observed as well. In November 2016 the city council concluded officially that a further rise in medium temperature, a higher number of heat extremes, a rise in the number of hot days and nights with temperatures higher than 20 \u00b0C (tropical nights), a change in precipitation patterns, as well as a rise in the number of local instances of heavy rain, is to be expected as part of the ongoing climate change. The city administration decided to support a joint study from its own Referat f\u00fcr Gesundheit und Umwelt (department for health and environmental issues) and the German Meteorological Service that will gather data on local weather. The data is supposed to be used to create a plan for action for adapting the city to better deal with climate change as well as an integrated action program for climate protection in <this city>. With the help of those programs issues regarding spatial planning and settlement density, the development of buildings and green spaces as well as plans for functioning ventilation in a cityscape can be monitored and managed.\n\nDemographics\nFrom only 24,000 inhabitants in 1700, the city population doubled about every 30 years. It was 100,000 in 1852, 250,000 in 1883 and 500,000 in 1901. Since then, <this city> has become <this country>'s third-largest city. In 1933, 840,901 inhabitants were counted, and in 1957 over 1 million. <this city> has reached 1.5 million in 2022.\n\nImmigration\nIn July 2017, <this city> had 1.42 million inhabitants; 421,832 foreign nationals resided in the city as of 31 December 2017 with 50.7% of these residents being citizens of EU member states, and 25.2% citizens in European states not in the EU (including Russia and Turkey). Along with the Turks, the Croats are one of the two largest foreign minorities in the city, which is why some Croats refer to <this city> as their \"second capital.\" The largest groups of foreign nationals were Turks (39,204), Croats (33,177), Italians (27,340), Greeks (27,117), Poles (27,945), Austrians (21,944), and Romanians (18,085).\n\nReligion\nAbout 45% of <this city>'s residents are not affiliated with any religious group; this ratio represents the fastest growing segment of the population. As in the rest of <this country>, the Catholic and Protestant churches have experienced a continuous decline in membership. As of 31 December 2017, 31.8% of the city's inhabitants were Catholic, 11.4% Protestant, 0.3% Jewish, and 3.6% were members of an Orthodox Church (Eastern Orthodox or Oriental Orthodox). About 1% adhere to other Christian denominations. There is also a small Old Catholic parish and an English-speaking parish of the Episcopal Church in the city. According to <this city> Statistical Office, in 2013 about 8.6% of <this city>'s population was Muslim.\n<this city> has the largest Uyghur population with about 800 (whole <this country> about 1,600) people with Uyghur diaspora. Many of them fled to <this city> due to the Chinese government and are exiled in <this city>. <this city> is also home to World Uyghur Congress, which is an international organisation of exiled Uyghurs.\n\nGovernment and politics\nAs the capital of Bavaria, <this city> is an important political centre for both the state and country as a whole. It is the seat of the Landtag of Bavaria, the State Chancellery, and all state departments. Several national and international authorities are located in <this city>, including the Federal Finance Court of <this country>, the German Patent Office and the European Patent Office.\n\nMayor\nThe current mayor of <this city> is Dieter Reiter, he is Social Democratic Party of <this country> (SPD). He was elected in 2014 and re-elected in 2020.

The number of districts is about 50, and if smaller units are counted as well, there are about 90 to 100 (see map). The three largest districts are Schwabing in the north (about 110,000 inhabitants), Sendling in the southwest (about 100,000 inhabitants), and Giesing in the south (about 80,000 inhabitants).\n\nArchitecture\nOld Town\nAt the centre of the old town is the Marienplatz with the Old Town Hall and the New Town Hall. Its tower contains the Rathaus-Glockenspiel. The Peterskirche is the oldest church of the inner city.

Northwest of Nymphenburg Palace is Schloss Blutenburg (Blutenburg Castle).The large <this city> Residenz complex on the edge of <this city>'s Old Town now ranks among Europe's most significant museums of interior decoration. Within the Residenz is the splendid Cuvilli\u00e9s Theatre and next door is the National Theatre <this city>. Among the mansions that still exist in <this city> are the Palais Porcia, the Palais Preysing, the Palais Holnstein and the Prinz-Carl-Palais. All mansions are situated close to the Residenz, so is the Alter Hof, the first residence of the House of Wittelsbach.\n\nModernist architecture\nDespite <this city> being the breeding ground for German Jugendstil, starting with the architect Martin D\u00fclfer, <this city> Jugendstil style was quickly submerged in historic trash. While the modernist architect Theodor Fischer was based in <this city>, his influence on <this city> underwhelmed. Prior to 1914 the city of <this city> was under-industrialized. During the Weimar Republic, the <this city> establishment was hostile to modernism. The TUM professor German Bestelmeyer favored a conservative style, and Jacobus Oud was rejected for the post of city building chief. Modernist exceptions include a series of post offices by Robert Vorhoelzer built in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Examples of avant-garde temporary constructions include the Wohnmaschine (Housing Machine) by Robert Vorhoelzer, as well as the Flachdachhaus (Flat Roof House) by Fritz Norkauer.

LaSie is aligned with the strategic development plan passed for <this city> in 1998 (\"Perspektive M\u00fcnchen\"). LaSie defines three priorities for the construction of residential housing in <this city>. Existing housing estates, post-war low-density developments, and the suburban area are subject to densification (\"Nachverdichtung\"). Non-residential industrial areas are subject to conservation and will be turned into residential and mixed-use areas. On greenfield sites in the <this city> periphery medium and large-scale housing estates are to be built so as to extend <this city>'s urban center.\n\nParks\nFriedrich Ludwig von Sckell became famous for designing the Englischer Garten between 1789 and 1807. Besides planning the first public garden in Europe, Sckell also redesigned Baroque gardens as landscape gardens, including the parks of Nymphenburg Palace and the Botanischer Garten M\u00fcnchen-Nymphenburg.Other large green spaces are the Olympiapark, the Westpark and the Ostpark.

In September 2011 the DOSB President Thomas Bach confirmed that <this city> would bid again for the Winter Olympics in the future. These plans were abandoned some time later.\n\nRoad running\nRegular annual road running events in <this city> are the <this city> Marathon in October, the Stadtlauf end of June, the company run B2Run in July, the New Year's Run on 31 December, the Spartan Race Sprint, the Olympia Alm Crosslauf and the Bestzeitenmarathon.\n\nSwimming\nPublic sporting facilities in <this city> include ten indoor swimming pools and eight outdoor swimming pools, which are operated by the <this city> City Utilities (SWM) communal company.

Schwabing was an epicenter for both literature and the fine arts, with numerous German and non-German artists living there.Vladimir Lenin authored What Is to Be Done? while living in Schwabing. Central to Schwabing's bohemian scene were K\u00fcnstlerlokale (Artist's Caf\u00e9s) like Caf\u00e9 Stefanie or Kabarett Simpl, whose liberal ways differed fundamentally from <this city>'s more traditional localities. The Simpl, which survives to this day, was named after <this city>'s anti-authoritarian satirical magazine Simplicissimus, founded in 1896 by Albert Langen and Thomas Theodor Heine, which quickly became an important organ of the Schwabinger Boh\u00e8me. Its caricatures and biting satirical attacks on Wilhelmine German society were the result of countless of collaborative efforts by many of the best visual artists and writers from <this city> and elsewhere.In 1971 Eckart Witzigmann teamed up with a <this city> building contractor to finance and open the Tantris restaurant in Schwabing. Witzigmann is credited for starting the German K\u00fcchenwunder (kitchen wonder).\n\nBiedermeier\nThe Biedermeier era was named after a character that regularly appeared in the satire magazine M\u00fcnchner Fliegende Bl\u00e4tter (Loose <this city> Pages), which was published by Adolf Kussmaul and Ludwig Eichrodt in <this city> between 1855 and 1857.

Bars in the Schwabing district of this era include, among many others, Schwabinger 7 and Schwabinger Podium. Since the 1980s, however, Schwabing has lost much of its nightlife activity due to gentrification and the resulting high rents, and the formerly wild artists' and students' quarter developed into one of the city's most coveted and expensive residential districts, attracting affluent citizens with little interest in partying.Since the 1960s, the Rosa Viertel (pink quarter) developed in the Glockenbachviertel and around G\u00e4rtnerplatz, which in the 1980s made <this city> \"one of the four gayest metropolises in the world\" along with San Francisco, New York City and Amsterdam. In particular, the area around M\u00fcllerstra\u00dfe and Hans-Sachs-Stra\u00dfe was characterized by numerous gay bars and nightclubs. One of them was the travesty nightclub Old Mrs. Henderson, where Freddie Mercury, who lived in <this city> from 1979 to 1985, filmed the music video for the song Living on My Own at his 39th birthday party.Since the mid-1990s, the Kunstpark Ost and its successor Kultfabrik, a former industrial complex that was converted to a large party area near M\u00fcnchen Ostbahnhof in Berg am Laim, hosted more than 30 clubs and was especially popular among younger people from the metropolitan area surrounding <this city> and tourists. The Kultfabrik was closed at the end of the year 2015 to convert the area into a residential and office area. Apart from the Kultfarbik and the smaller Optimolwerke, there is a wide variety of establishments in the urban parts of nearby Haidhausen. Before the Kunstpark Ost, there had already been an accumulation of internationally known nightclubs in the remains of the abandoned former <this city>-Riem Airport.\n<this city> nightlife tends to change dramatically and quickly. Establishments open and close every year, and due to gentrification and the overheated housing market many survive only a few years, while others last longer.
