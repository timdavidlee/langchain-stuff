  "wiki_text": "<this city> ( bur-LIN, German: [b\u025b\u0281\u02c8li\u02d0n] (listen)) is the capital and largest city of <this country> by both area and population. Its more than 3.85 million inhabitants make it the European Union's most populous city, according to population within city limits. One of <this country>'s sixteen constituent states, <this city> is surrounded by the State of Brandenburg and contiguous with Potsdam, Brandenburg's capital. <this city>'s urban area, which has a population of around 4.5 million, is the second most populous urban area in <this country> after the Ruhr. The <this city>-Brandenburg capital region has around 6.2 million inhabitants and is <this country>'s third-largest metropolitan region after the Rhine-Ruhr and Rhine-Main regions.<this city> straddles the banks of the Spree, which flows into the Havel (a tributary of the Elbe) in the western borough of Spandau. Among the city's main topographical features are the many lakes in the western and southeastern boroughs formed by the Spree, Havel and Dahme, the largest of which is Lake M\u00fcggelsee. Due to its location in the European Plain, <this city> is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. About one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers, canals, and lakes. The city lies in the Central German dialect area, the <this city> dialect being spoken.\nFirst documented in the 13th century and at the crossing of two important historic trade routes, <this city> became the capital of the Margraviate of Brandenburg (1417\u20131701), Kingdom of Prussia (1701\u20131918), German Empire (1871\u20131918), Weimar Republic (1919\u20131933), and Nazi <this country> (1933\u20131945). <this city> has served as a scientific, artistic and philosophical hub of the Enlightenment, Neoclassicism, and liberal revolution. The Gr\u00fcnderzeit era's \nindustrialization-induced economic boom multiplied <this city>'s population rapidly. <this city> in the roaring 1920s was the third-largest city in the world by population.After World War II and its subsequent occupation by the victorious countries, the devastated city was divided; West <this city> became a de facto exclave of West <this country>, surrounded by the <this city> Wall (from August 1961 to November 1989) and East German territory. East <this city> was declared capital of East <this country>, while Bonn became the West German capital. Following German reunification in 1990, <this city> once again became the capital of all of <this country>.\n<this city> is a world city of culture, politics, media and science. Its economy is based on high-tech firms and the service sector, encompassing a diverse range of creative industries, startup companies, research facilities, media corporations, and convention venues. <this city> serves as a continental hub for air and rail traffic and has a highly complex public transportation network. The metropolis is a popular tourist destination. Significant industries also include information technology, healthcare, biomedical engineering, biotechnology, automotive, construction, electronics, social economy and clean tech.\n<this city> is home to world-renowned universities such as the Humboldt University, Technical University, Free University, University of the Arts, ESMT <this city>, Hertie School, and Bard College <this city>. Its Zoological Garden is the most visited zoo in Europe and one of the most popular worldwide. With Babelsberg being the world's first large-scale movie studio complex, <this city> is an increasingly popular location for international film productions. The city is well known for its festivals, diverse architecture, nightlife, contemporary arts, and high quality of life.<this city> is also home to three World Heritage Sites: Museum Island; the Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and <this city>; and the Modernism Housing Estates. Other landmarks include the Brandenburg Gate, Reichstag building, Potsdamer Platz, Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, <this city> Wall Memorial, East Side Gallery, <this city> Victory Column, <this city> Cathedral, and <this city> Television Tower, the tallest structure in <this country>. <this city> has numerous museums, galleries, libraries, orchestras, and sporting events including Museum Island, the German Historical Museum, Jewish Museum, Natural History Museum, State Library, State Opera, Philharmonic, and the <this city> Marathon.\n\nHistory\nEtymology\n<this city> lies in northeastern <this country>, east of the River Elbe, that once constituted, together with the River (Saxon or Thuringian) Saale (from their confluence at Barby onwards), the eastern border of the Frankish Realm. While the Frankish Realm was primarily inhabited by Germanic tribes like the Franks and the Saxons, the regions east of the border rivers were inhabited by Slavic tribes. This is why most of the cities and villages in northeastern <this country> bear Slavic-derived names (Germania Slavica). Typical Germanized place name suffixes of Slavic origin are -ow, -itz, -vitz, -witz, -itzsch and -in, prefixes are Windisch and Wendisch. The name <this city> has its roots in the language of West Slavic inhabitants of the area of today's <this city>, and may be related to the Old Polabian stem berl-/birl- (\"swamp\"). or Proto-Slavic b\u044crlog\u044a, (lair, den). Since the Ber- at the beginning sounds like the German word B\u00e4r (\"bear\"), a bear appears in the coat of arms of the city. It is therefore an example of canting arms.\nOf <this city>'s twelve boroughs, five bear a (partly) Slavic-derived name: Pankow (the most populous), Steglitz-Zehlendorf, Marzahn-Hellersdorf, Treptow-K\u00f6penick and Spandau (named Spandow until 1878). Of its ninety-six neighborhoods, twenty-two bear a (partly) Slavic-derived name: Altglienicke, Alt-Treptow, Britz, Buch, Buckow, Gatow, Karow, Kladow, K\u00f6penick, Lankwitz, L\u00fcbars, Malchow, Marzahn, Pankow, Prenzlauer Berg, Rudow, Schm\u00f6ckwitz, Spandau, Stadtrandsiedlung Malchow, Steglitz, Tegel and Zehlendorf. The neighborhood of Moabit bears a French-derived name, and Franz\u00f6sisch Buchholz is named after the Huguenots.\n\nPrehistory of <this city>\nThe earliest human traces in the area of modern <this city> are dated around 60,000 BC. A Mesolithic deer antler mask found in Biesdorf (<this city>) was dated around 9000 BC. During Neolithic times a large number of communities existed in the area and in the  Bronze Age up to 1000 people lived in 50 villages. Early Germanic tribes took settlement from 500 BC. Slavic settlements and castles began around 750 AD.\n\n12th to 16th centuries\nThe earliest evidence of middle age settlements in the area of today's <this city> are remnants of a house foundation dated to 1174, found in excavations in <this city> Mitte, and a wooden beam dated from approximately 1192. The first written records of towns in the area of present-day <this city> date from the late 12th century. Spandau is first mentioned in 1197 and K\u00f6penick in 1209, although these areas did not join <this city> until 1920. The central part of <this city> can be traced back to two towns. C\u00f6lln on the Fischerinsel is first mentioned in a 1237 document, and <this city>, across the Spree in what is now called the Nikolaiviertel, is referenced in a document from 1244. 1237 is considered the founding date of the city. The two towns over time formed close economic and social ties, and profited from the staple right on the two important trade routes Via Imperii and from Bruges to Novgorod. In 1307, they formed an alliance with a common external policy, their internal administrations still being separated.In 1415, Frederick I became the elector of the Margraviate of Brandenburg, which he ruled until 1440. During the 15th century, his successors established <this city>-C\u00f6lln as capital of the margraviate, and subsequent members of the Hohenzollern family ruled in <this city> until 1918, first as electors of Brandenburg, then as kings of Prussia, and eventually as German emperors. In 1443, Frederick II Irontooth started the construction of a new royal palace in the twin city <this city>-C\u00f6lln. The protests of the town citizens against the building culminated in 1448, in the \"<this city> Indignation\" (\"<this city>er Unwille\"). This protest was not successful and the citizenry lost many of its political and economic privileges. After the royal palace was finished in 1451, it gradually came into use. From 1470, with the new elector Albrecht III Achilles, <this city>-C\u00f6lln became the new royal residence. Officially, the <this city>-C\u00f6lln palace became permanent residence of the Brandenburg electors of the Hohenzollerns from 1486, when John Cicero came to power. <this city>-C\u00f6lln, however, had to give up its status as a free Hanseatic city. In 1539, the electors and the city officially became Lutheran.\n\n17th to 19th centuries\nThe Thirty Years' War between 1618 and 1648 devastated <this city>. One third of its houses were damaged or destroyed, and the city lost half of its population. Frederick William, known as the \"Great Elector\", who had succeeded his father George William as ruler in 1640, initiated a policy of promoting immigration and religious tolerance. With the Edict of Potsdam in 1685, Frederick William offered asylum to the French Huguenots.By 1700, approximately 30 percent of <this city>'s residents were French, because of the Huguenot immigration. Many other immigrants came from Bohemia, Poland, and Salzburg.\nSince 1618, the Margraviate of Brandenburg had been in personal union with the Duchy of Prussia. In 1701, the dual state formed the Kingdom of Prussia, as Frederick III, Elector of Brandenburg, crowned himself as king Frederick I in Prussia. <this city> became the capital of the new Kingdom, replacing K\u00f6nigsberg. This was a successful attempt to centralise the capital in the very far-flung state, and it was the first time the city began to grow. In 1709, <this city> merged with the four cities of C\u00f6lln, Friedrichswerder, Friedrichstadt and Dorotheenstadt under the name <this city>, \"Haupt- und Residenzstadt <this city>\".In 1740, Frederick II, known as Frederick the Great (1740\u20131786), came to power. Under the rule of Frederick II, <this city> became a center of the Enlightenment, but also, was briefly occupied during the Seven Years' War by the Russian army. Following France's victory in the War of the Fourth Coalition, Napoleon Bonaparte marched into <this city> in 1806, but granted self-government to the city. In 1815, the city became part of the new Province of Brandenburg.The Industrial Revolution transformed <this city> during the 19th century; the city's economy and population expanded dramatically, and it became the main railway hub and economic center of <this country>. Additional suburbs soon developed and increased the area and population of <this city>. In 1861, neighboring suburbs including Wedding, Moabit and several others were incorporated into <this city>. In 1871, <this city> became capital of the newly founded German Empire. In 1881, it became a city district separate from Brandenburg.\n\n20th to 21st centuries\nIn the early 20th century, <this city> had become a fertile ground for the German Expressionist movement. In fields such as architecture, painting and cinema new forms of artistic styles were invented. At the end of the First World War in 1918, a republic was proclaimed by Philipp Scheidemann at the Reichstag building. In 1920, the Greater <this city> Act incorporated dozens of suburban cities, villages, and estates around <this city> into an expanded city. The act increased the area of <this city> from 66 to 883 km2 (25 to 341 sq mi). The population almost doubled, and <this city> had a population of around four million. During the Weimar era, <this city> underwent political unrest due to economic uncertainties but also became a renowned center of the Roaring Twenties. The metropolis experienced its heyday as a major world capital and was known for its leadership roles in science, technology, arts, the humanities, city planning, film, higher education, government, and industries. Albert Einstein rose to public prominence during his years in <this city>, being awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1921.In 1933, Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party came to power. Hitler was inspired by the architecture he had experienced in Vienna, and he wished for a German Empire with a capital city that had a monumental ensemble. The National Socialist regime embarked on monumental construction projects in <this city> as a way to express their power and authority through architecture. Adolf Hitler and Albert Speer developed architectural concepts for the conversion of the city into World Capital Germania; these were never implemented.NSDAP rule diminished <this city>'s Jewish community from 160,000 (one-third of all Jews in the country) to about 80,000 due to emigration between 1933 and 1939. After Kristallnacht in 1938, thousands of the city's Jews were imprisoned in the nearby Sachsenhausen concentration camp. Starting in early 1943, many were shipped to concentration camps, such as Auschwitz.<this city> hosted the 1936 Summer Olympics for which the Olympic stadium was built.\nDuring World War II, large parts of <this city> were destroyed during 1943\u201345 Allied air raids and the 1945 Battle of <this city>. The Allies dropped 67,607 tons of bombs on the city, destroying 6,427 acres of the built-up area. Around 125,000 civilians were killed. After the end of World War II in Europe in May 1945, <this city> received large numbers of refugees from the Eastern provinces. The victorious powers divided the city into four sectors, analogous to Allied-occupied <this country> the sectors of the Allies of World War II (the United States, the United Kingdom, and France) formed West <this city>, while the Soviet Union formed East <this city>.\nAll four Allies of World War II shared administrative responsibilities for <this city>. However, in 1948, when the Western Allies extended the currency reform in the Western zones of <this country> to the three western sectors of <this city>, the Soviet Union imposed the <this city> Blockade on the access routes to and from West <this city>, which lay entirely inside Soviet-controlled territory. The <this city> airlift, conducted by the three western Allies, overcame this blockade by supplying food and other supplies to the city from June 1948 to May 1949. In 1949, the Federal Republic of <this country> was founded in West <this country> and eventually included all of the American, British and French zones, excluding those three countries' zones in <this city>, while the Marxist\u2013Leninist German Democratic Republic was proclaimed in East <this country>. West <this city> officially remained an occupied city, but it politically was aligned with the Federal Republic of <this country> despite West <this city>'s geographic isolation. Airline service to West <this city> was granted only to American, British and French airlines.\n\nThe founding of the two German states increased Cold War tensions. West <this city> was surrounded by East German territory, and East <this country> proclaimed the Eastern part as its capital, a move the western powers did not recognize. East <this city> included most of the city's historic center. The West German government established itself in Bonn. In 1961, East <this country> began to build the <this city> Wall around West <this city>, and events escalated to a tank standoff at Checkpoint Charlie. West <this city> was now de facto a part of West <this country> with a unique legal status, while East <this city> was de facto a part of East <this country>. John F. Kennedy gave his \"Ich bin ein <this city>er\" speech on 26 June 1963, in front of the Sch\u00f6neberg city hall, located in the city's western part, underlining the US support for West <this city>. <this city> was completely divided. Although it was possible for Westerners to pass to the other side through strictly controlled checkpoints, for most Easterners, travel to West <this city> or West <this country> was prohibited by the government of East <this country>. In 1971, a Four-Power agreement guaranteed access to and from West <this city> by car or train through East <this country>.In 1989, with the end of the Cold War and pressure from the East German population, the <this city> Wall fell on 9 November and was subsequently mostly demolished. Today, the East Side Gallery preserves a large portion of the wall. On 3 October 1990, the two parts of <this country> were reunified as the Federal Republic of <this country>, and <this city> again became a reunified city. Walter Momper, the mayor of West <this city>, became the first mayor of the reunified city in the interim. City-wide elections in December 1990 resulted in the first \"all <this city>\" mayor being elected to take office in January 1991, with the separate offices of mayors in East and West <this city> expiring by that time, and Eberhard Diepgen (a former mayor of West <this city>) became the first elected mayor of a reunited <this city>. On 18 June 1994, soldiers from the United States, France and Britain marched in a parade which was part of the ceremonies to mark the withdrawal of allied occupation troops allowing a reunified <this city> (the last Russian troops departed on 31 August, while the final departure of Western Allies forces was on 8 September 1994). On 20 June 1991, the Bundestag (German Parliament) voted to move the seat of the German capital from Bonn to <this city>, which was completed in 1999, during the chancellorship of Gerhard Schr\u00f6der.\n\n<this city>'s 2001 administrative reform merged several boroughs, reducing their number from 23 to 12.\nIn 2006, the FIFA World Cup Final was held in <this city>.\nIn a 2016 terrorist attack linked to ISIL, a truck was deliberately driven into a Christmas market next to the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, leaving 13 people dead and 55 others injured.In 2018, more than 200,000 protestors took to the streets in <this city> with demonstrations of racism for solidarity against the emergence of far-right politics in <this country>.\n<this city> Brandenburg Airport (BER) opened in 2020, nine years later than planned, with Terminal 1 coming into service at the end of October, and flights to and from Tegel Airport ending in November. Due to the fall in passenger numbers resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, plans were announced to temporarily close BER's Terminal 5, the former Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport, beginning in March 2021 for up to one year. The connecting link of U-Bahn line U5 from Alexanderplatz to Hauptbahnhof, along with the new stations Rotes Rathaus and Unter den Linden, opened on 4 December 2020, with the Museumsinsel U-Bahn station expected to open around March 2021, which would complete all new works on the U5. A partial opening by the end of 2020 of the Humboldt Forum museum, housed in the reconstructed <this city> Palace, which had been announced in June, was postponed until March 2021.\n\n<this city>-Brandenburg fusion attempt\nThe legal basis for a combined state of <this city> and Brandenburg is different from other state fusion proposals. Normally, Article 29 of the Basic Law stipulates that a state fusion requires a federal law. However, a clause added to the Basic Law in 1994, Article 118a, allows <this city> and Brandenburg to unify without federal approval, requiring a referendum and a ratification by both state parliaments.In 1996, there was an unsuccessful attempt of unifying the states of <this city> and Brandenburg. Both share a common history, dialect and culture and in 2020, there are over 225.000 residents of Brandenburg that commute to <this city>. The fusion had the near-unanimous support by a broad coalition of both state governments, political parties, media, business associations, trade unions and churches. Though <this city> voted in favor by a small margin, largely based on support in former West <this city>, Brandenburg voters disapproved of the fusion by a large margin. It failed largely due to Brandenburg voters not wanting to take on <this city>'s large and growing public debt and fearing losing identity and influence to the capital.\n\nGeography\nTopography\n<this city> is in northeastern <this country>, in an area of low-lying marshy woodlands with a mainly flat topography, part of the vast Northern European Plain which stretches all the way from northern France to western Russia. The <this city>er Urstromtal (an ice age glacial valley), between the low Barnim Plateau to the north and the Teltow plateau to the south, was formed by meltwater flowing from ice sheets at the end of the last Weichselian glaciation. The Spree follows this valley now. In Spandau, a borough in the west of <this city>, the Spree empties into the river Havel, which flows from north to south through western <this city>. The course of the Havel is more like a chain of lakes, the largest being the Tegeler See and the Gro\u00dfer Wannsee. A series of lakes also feeds into the upper Spree, which flows through the Gro\u00dfer M\u00fcggelsee in eastern <this city>.Substantial parts of present-day <this city> extend onto the low plateaus on both sides of the Spree Valley. Large parts of the boroughs Reinickendorf and Pankow lie on the Barnim Plateau, while most of the boroughs of Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf, Steglitz-Zehlendorf, Tempelhof-Sch\u00f6neberg, and Neuk\u00f6lln lie on the Teltow Plateau.\nThe borough of Spandau lies partly within the <this city> Glacial Valley and partly on the Nauen Plain, which stretches to the west of <this city>. Since 2015, the Arkenberge hills in Pankow at 122 meters (400 ft) elevation, have been the highest point in <this city>. Through the disposal of construction debris they surpassed Teufelsberg (120.1 m or 394 ft), which itself was made up of rubble from the ruins of the Second World War. The M\u00fcggelberge at 114.7 meters (376 ft) elevation is the highest natural point and the lowest is the Spektesee in Spandau, at 28.1 meters (92 ft) elevation.\n\nClimate\n<this city> has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb); the eastern part of the city has a humid continental climate (Dfb), one of the changes being the annual rainfall according to the air masses and the greater abundance during a period of the year. This type of climate features moderate summer temperatures but sometimes hot (for being semicontinental) and cold winters but not rigorous most of the time.Due to its transitional climate zones, frosts are common in winter, and there are larger temperature differences between seasons than typical for many oceanic climates. Furthermore, <this city> is classified as a temperate continental climate (Dc) under the Trewartha climate scheme, as well as the suburbs of New York City, although the K\u00f6ppen system puts them in different types.Summers are warm and sometimes humid with average high temperatures of 22\u201325 \u00b0C (72\u201377 \u00b0F) and lows of 12\u201314 \u00b0C (54\u201357 \u00b0F). Winters are cool with average high temperatures of 3 \u00b0C (37 \u00b0F) and lows of \u22122 to 0 \u00b0C (28 to 32 \u00b0F). Spring and autumn are generally chilly to mild. <this city>'s built-up area creates a microclimate, with heat stored by the city's buildings and pavement. Temperatures can be 4 \u00b0C (7 \u00b0F) higher in the city than in the surrounding areas. Annual precipitation is 570 millimeters (22 in) with moderate rainfall throughout the year. Snowfall mainly occurs from December through March. The hottest month in <this city> was July 1834, with a mean temperature of 23.0 \u00b0C (73.4 \u00b0F) and the coldest was January 1709, with a mean temperature of \u221213.2 \u00b0C (8.2 \u00b0F). The wettest month on record was July 1907, with 230 millimeters (9.1 in) of rainfall, whereas the driest were October 1866, November 1902, October 1908 and September 1928, all with 1 millimeter (0.039 in) of rainfall.\n\nCityscape\n<this city>'s history has left the city with a polycentric organization and a highly eclectic array of architecture and buildings. The city's appearance today has been predominantly shaped by the key role it played in <this country>'s history during the 20th century. All of the national governments based in <this city> \u2013  the Kingdom of Prussia, the 2nd German Empire of 1871, the Weimar Republic, Nazi <this country>, East <this country>, as well as the reunified <this country> \u2013  initiated ambitious reconstruction programs, with each adding its own distinctive style to the city's architecture.\n<this city> was devastated by air raids, fires, and street battles during the Second World War, and many of the buildings that had survived in both East and West were demolished during the postwar period. Much of this demolition was initiated by municipal architecture programs to build new business or residential districts and the main arteries. Much ornamentation on prewar buildings was destroyed following modernist dogmas, and in both postwar systems, as well as in the reunified <this city>, many important heritage structures have been reconstructed, including the Forum Fridericianum along with, the State Opera (1955), Charlottenburg Palace (1957), the monumental buildings on Gendarmenmarkt (1980s), Kommandantur (2003) and also the project to reconstruct the baroque fa\u00e7ades of the City Palace. Many new buildings have been inspired by their historical predecessors or the general classical style of <this city>, such as Hotel Adlon.\nClusters of towers rise at various locations: Potsdamer Platz, the City West, and Alexanderplatz, the latter two delineating the former centers of East and West <this city>, with the first representing a new <this city> of the 21st century, risen from the wastes of no-man's land of the <this city> Wall. <this city> has five of the top 50 tallest buildings in <this country>.\nOver one-third of the city area consists of green space, woodlands, and water. <this city>'s second-largest and most popular park, the Gro\u00dfer Tiergarten, is located right in the center of the city. It covers an area of 210 hectares and stretches from Bahnhof Zoo in the City West to the Brandenburg Gate in the east.\nAmong famous streets, Unter den Linden and Friedrichstra\u00dfe are found in the city's historic heart (and were included in the former East <this city>). Some major streets in City West are Kurf\u00fcrstendamm (or just Ku\u00b4damm) and Kantstra\u00dfe.\n\nArchitecture\nThe Fernsehturm (TV tower) at Alexanderplatz in Mitte is among the tallest structures in the European Union at 368 m (1,207 ft). Built in 1969, it is visible throughout most of the central districts of <this city>. The city can be viewed from its 204-meter-high (669 ft) observation floor. Starting here, the Karl-Marx-Allee heads east, an avenue lined by monumental residential buildings, designed in the Socialist Classicism style. Adjacent to this area is the Rotes Rathaus (City Hall), with its distinctive red-brick architecture. In front of it is the Neptunbrunnen, a fountain featuring a mythological group of Tritons, personifications of the four main Prussian rivers, and Neptune on top of it.\nThe Brandenburg Gate is an iconic landmark of <this city> and <this country>; it stands as a symbol of eventful European history and of unity and peace. The Reichstag building is the traditional seat of the German Parliament. It was remodeled by British architect Norman Foster in the 1990s and features a glass dome over the session area, which allows free public access to the parliamentary proceedings and magnificent views of the city.\nThe East Side Gallery is an open-air exhibition of art painted directly on the last existing portions of the <this city> Wall. It is the largest remaining evidence of the city's historical division.\nThe Gendarmenmarkt is a neoclassical square in <this city>, the name of which derives from the headquarters of the famous Gens d'armes regiment located here in the 18th century. Two similarly designed cathedrals border it, the Franz\u00f6sischer Dom with its observation platform and the Deutscher Dom. The Konzerthaus (Concert Hall), home of the <this city> Symphony Orchestra, stands between the two cathedrals.\n\nThe Museum Island in the River Spree houses five museums built from 1830 to 1930 and is a UNESCO World Heritage site. Restoration and construction of a main entrance to all museums, as well as reconstruction of the Stadtschloss continues. Also on the island and next to the Lustgarten and palace is <this city> Cathedral, emperor William II's ambitious attempt to create a Protestant counterpart to St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. A large crypt houses the remains of some of the earlier Prussian royal family. St. Hedwig's Cathedral is <this city>'s Roman Catholic cathedral.\n\nUnter den Linden is a tree-lined east\u2013west avenue from the Brandenburg Gate to the site of the former <this city>er Stadtschloss, and was once <this city>'s premier promenade. Many Classical buildings line the street, and part of Humboldt University is there. Friedrichstra\u00dfe was <this city>'s legendary street during the Golden Twenties. It combines 20th-century traditions with the modern architecture of today's <this city>.\nPotsdamer Platz is an entire quarter built from scratch after the Wall came down. To the west of Potsdamer Platz is the Kulturforum, which houses the Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, and is flanked by the Neue Nationalgalerie and the <this city>er Philharmonie. The Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, a Holocaust memorial, is to the north.The area around Hackescher Markt is home to fashionable culture, with countless clothing outlets, clubs, bars, and galleries. This includes the Hackesche H\u00f6fe, a conglomeration of buildings around several courtyards, reconstructed around 1996. The nearby New Synagogue is the center of Jewish culture.\nThe Stra\u00dfe des 17. Juni, connecting the Brandenburg Gate and Ernst-Reuter-Platz, serves as the central east\u2013west axis. Its name commemorates the uprisings in East <this city> of 17 June 1953. Approximately halfway from the Brandenburg Gate is the Gro\u00dfer Stern, a circular traffic island on which the Siegess\u00e4ule (Victory Column) is situated. This monument, built to commemorate Prussia's victories, was relocated in 1938\u201339 from its previous position in front of the Reichstag.\nThe Kurf\u00fcrstendamm is home to some of <this city>'s luxurious stores with the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church at its eastern end on Breitscheidplatz. The church was destroyed in the Second World War and left in ruins. Nearby on Tauentzienstra\u00dfe is KaDeWe, claimed to be continental Europe's largest department store.

The Greater <this city> Act in 1920 incorporated many suburbs and surrounding cities of <this city>. It formed most of the territory that comprises modern <this city> and increased the population from 1.9 million to 4 million.\nActive immigration and asylum politics in West <this city> triggered waves of immigration in the 1960s and 1970s. <this city> is home to at least 180,000 Turkish and Turkish German residents, making it the largest Turkish community outside of Turkey. In the 1990s the Aussiedlergesetze enabled immigration to <this country> of some residents from the former Soviet Union.

According to the <this city> residents register, in 2018 14.9 percent were members of the Evangelical Church, and 8.5 percent were members of the Catholic Church. The government keeps a register of members of these churches for tax purposes, because it collects church tax on behalf of the churches.
