  "wiki_text": "<this city> (; <this country>ese: \u6771\u4eac, T\u014dky\u014d, [to\u02d0k\u02b2o\u02d0] (listen)), officially the <this city> Metropolis (\u6771\u4eac\u90fd, T\u014dky\u014d-to), is the capital and most populous city of <this country>. Formerly known as Edo, its metropolitan area (including neighboring prefectures, 13,452 square kilometers or 5,194 square miles) is the most populous in the world, with an estimated 37.468 million residents as of 2018; although this number has been gradually decreasing since then, the prefecture itself has a population of 14.09 million people while the city's central 23 special wards have a population of 9.73 million. Located at the head of <this city> Bay, the prefecture forms part of the Kant\u014d region on the central coast of Honshu, <this country>'s largest island. <this city> serves as <this country>'s economic center and is the seat of both the <this country>ese government and the Emperor of <this country>.\nOriginally a fishing village named Edo, the city became politically prominent in 1603, when it became the seat of the Tokugawa shogunate. By the mid-18th century, Edo was one of the most populous cities in the world with a population of over one million people. Following the Meiji Restoration of 1868, the imperial capital in Kyoto was moved to Edo, which was renamed \"<this city>\" (lit.\u2009'Eastern Capital'). <this city> was devastated by the 1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake, and again by Allied bombing raids during World War II. Beginning in the 1950s, the city underwent rapid reconstruction and expansion efforts, going on to lead the <this country>ese economic miracle. In 1968, <this country> became the second largest economy, only behind the United States. Since 1943, the <this city> Metropolitan Government has administered the prefecture's special wards (formerly <this city> City), various commuter towns and suburbs in its western area, and two outlying island chains known as the <this city> Islands.\n<this city> is the largest urban economy in the world by gross domestic product, and is categorized as an Alpha+ city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. It is also <this country>'s leading business hub as part of an industrial region that includes the cities of Yokohama, Kawasaki, and Chiba. As of 2021, <this city> is home to 37 companies of the Fortune Global 500. In 2020, the city ranked fourth on the Global Financial Centres Index, behind only New York City, London, and Shanghai. <this city> is home to the world's tallest tower, <this city> Skytree, and the world's largest underground floodwater diversion facility, the Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel (located in Kasukabe, Saitama, a suburb of <this city>). The <this city> Metro Ginza Line, opened in 1927, is the oldest underground metro line in East Asia. Recognized as one of the most livable cities in the world, <this city> was tied fourth with Wellington in the 2021 Global Livability Ranking.The city has hosted multiple international events, including the 1964 Summer Olympics and 1964 Summer Paralympics, the 2020 Summer Olympics and 2020 Summer Paralympics (postponed; held in 2021), and three summits of the G7 (in 1979, 1986, and 1993). <this city> is an international research and development hub and is likewise represented by several major universities, most notably the University of <this city>. <this city> Station is the central hub for <this country>'s high-speed railway network, the Shinkansen; Shinjuku Station in <this city> is also the world's busiest train station. Notable special wards of <this city> include: Chiyoda, the site of the National Diet Building and the <this city> Imperial Palace; Shinjuku, the city's administrative center; and Shibuya, a commercial, cultural, and business hub.\n\nEtymology\n<this city> was originally known as Edo (\u6c5f\u6238), a kanji compound of \u6c5f (e, \"cove, inlet\") and \u6238 (to, \"entrance, gate, door\"). The name, which can be translated as \"estuary\", is a reference to the original settlement's location at the meeting of the Sumida River and <this city> Bay. During the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the name of the city was changed to <this city> (\u6771\u4eac, from \u6771 t\u014d \"east\", and \u4eac ky\u014d \"capital\"), when it became the new imperial capital, in line with the East Asian tradition of including the word capital (\u4eac) in the name of the capital city (for example, Kyoto (\u4eac\u90fd), Keij\u014d (\u4eac\u57ce), Beijing (\u5317\u4eac), Nanjing (\u5357\u4eac), and Xijing (\u897f\u4eac)). During the early Meiji period, the city was sometimes called \"T\u014dkei\", an alternative pronunciation for the same characters representing \"<this city>\", making it a kanji homograph. Some surviving official English documents use the spelling \"Tokei\"; however, this pronunciation is now obsolete.\n\nHistory\nPre-1869 (Edo period)\n<this city> was originally a village called Edo, in what was formerly part of the old Musashi Province. Edo was first fortified by the Edo clan, in the late twelfth century. In 1457, \u014cta D\u014dkan built Edo Castle. In 1590, Tokugawa Ieyasu moved from Mikawa Province (his lifelong base) to the Kant\u014d region. When he became sh\u014dgun in 1603, Edo became the center of his ruling. During the subsequent Edo period, Edo grew into one of the largest cities in the world with a population topping one million by the 18th century.Edo was still the home of the Tokugawa shogunate and not the capital of <this country> (the Emperor himself lived in Kyoto almost continuously from 794 to 1868). During the Edo era, the city enjoyed a prolonged period of peace known as the Pax Tokugawa, and in the presence of such peace, the shogunate adopted a stringent policy of seclusion, which helped to perpetuate the lack of any serious military threat to the city. The absence of war-inflicted devastation allowed Edo to devote the majority of its resources to rebuilding in the wake of the consistent fires, earthquakes, and other devastating natural disasters that plagued the city.\nThis prolonged period of seclusion however came to an end with the arrival of American Commodore Matthew C. Perry in 1853. Commodore Perry forced the opening of the ports of Shimoda and Hakodate, leading to an increase in the demand for new foreign goods and subsequently a severe rise in inflation. Social unrest mounted in the wake of these higher prices and culminated in widespread rebellions and demonstrations, especially in the form of the \"smashing\" of rice establishments. Meanwhile, supporters of the Emperor leveraged the disruption that these widespread rebellious demonstrations were causing to further consolidate power by overthrowing the last Tokugawa sh\u014dgun, Yoshinobu, in 1867. After 265 years, the Pax Tokugawa came to an end.\n\nGallery\n\n1869\u20131943\nEdo was renamed <this city> (Eastern Capital) on September 3, 1868, as the new government was consolidating its power after the fall of the Edo shogunate. The young Emperor Meiji visited once at the end of that year and eventually moved in in 1869. <this city> was already the nation's political center, and the emperor's residence made it a de facto imperial capital as well, with the former Edo Castle becoming the Imperial Palace. The city of <this city> was officially established on May 1, 1889.\nThe <this city> Metro Ginza Line portion between Ueno and Asakusa was the first subway line built in <this country> and East Asia completed on December 30, 1927. Central <this city>, like Osaka, has been designed since about 1900 to be centered on major railway stations in a high-density fashion, so suburban railways were built relatively cheaply at street level and with their own right-of-way. Though expressways have been built in <this city>, the basic design has not changed.<this city> went on to suffer two major catastrophes in the 20th century: the 1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake, which left 140,000 dead or missing; and World War II.\nGallery\n\n1943\u20131945\nIn 1943, the city of <this city> merged with the prefecture of <this city> to form the \"Metropolitan Prefecture\" of <this city>. Since then, the <this city> Metropolitan Government served as both the prefecture government for <this city>, as well as administering the special wards of <this city>, for what had previously been <this city> City. World War II wreaked widespread destruction of most of the city due to the persistent Allied air raids on <this country> and the use of incendiary bombs. The bombing of <this city> in 1944 and 1945 is estimated to have killed between 75,000 and 200,000 civilians and left more than half of the city destroyed.The deadliest night of the war came on March 9\u201310, 1945, the night of the American \"Operation Meetinghouse\" raid; as nearly 700,000 incendiary bombs rained on the eastern half of the city, mainly in heavily residential wards. Two-fifths of the city were completely burned, more than 276,000 buildings were demolished, 100,000 civilians were killed, and 110,000 more were injured. Between 1940 and 1945, the population of <this country>'s capital city dwindled from 6,700,000 to less than 2,800,000, with the majority of those who lost their homes living in \"ramshackle, makeshift huts\".\nGallery\n\n1945\u2013present\nAfter the war, <this city> became the base from which the United States under Douglas MacArthur administered <this country> for six years. <this city> struggled to rebuild as occupation authorities stepped in and drastically cut back on <this country>ese government rebuilding programs, focusing instead on simply improving roads and transportation. <this city> did not experience fast economic growth until the 1950s.After the occupation of <this country> ended in 1952, <this city> was completely rebuilt and was showcased to the world during the 1964 Summer Olympics, such as the Yoyogi National Gymnasium and the 0 Series Shinkansen, the first bullet train of its class in the world.  The 1970s and the 1980s brought new high-rise developments. In 1978, Sunshine 60 \u2013 the tallest skyscraper in Asia until 1985, and in <this country> until 1991 \u2013 and Narita International Airport were constructed, and the population increased to about 11 million in the metropolitan area. The Edo-<this city> Open Air Architectural Museum has historic <this country>ese buildings that existed in the urban landscape of pre-war <this city>.\n<this city>'s subway and commuter rail network became one of the busiest in the world as more and more people moved to the area. In the 1980s, real estate prices skyrocketed during a real estate and debt bubble. The bubble burst in the early 1990s, and many companies, banks, and individuals were caught with mortgage-backed debts while real estate was shrinking in value. A major recession followed, making the 1990s <this country>'s \"Lost Decade\", from which it is now slowly recovering.\n<this city> still sees new urban developments on large lots of less profitable land. Recent projects include Ebisu Garden Place, Tenn\u014dzu Isle, Shiodome, Roppongi Hills, Shinagawa (Shinagawa Station, a major hub for Shinkansen), and the Marunouchi side of <this city> Station. Buildings of significance have been demolished for more up-to-date shopping facilities such as Omotesando Hills.Land reclamation projects in <this city> have also been going on for centuries. The most prominent is the Odaiba area, now a major shopping and entertainment center. Various plans have been proposed for transferring national government functions from <this city> to secondary capitals in other regions of <this country>, to slow down rapid development in <this city> and revitalize economically lagging areas of the country. These plans have been controversial within <this country> and have yet to be realized.\nThe 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami that devastated much of the northeastern coast of Honshu was felt in <this city>. However, due to <this city>'s earthquake-resistant infrastructure, damage in <this city> was very minor compared to areas directly hit by the tsunami, although activity in the city was largely halted. The subsequent nuclear crisis caused by the tsunami has also largely left <this city> unaffected, despite occasional spikes in radiation levels.On September 7, 2013, the IOC selected <this city> to host the 2020 Summer Olympics. <this city> thus became the first Asian city to host the Olympic Games twice. However, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 Olympic Games took place from July 23, 2021, to August 8, 2021. It is also unclear how the city will deal with an increasing number of issues, urging scholars to offer possible alternatives approaches to tackle the most urgent problems. Although, the COVID-19 pandemic in <this city> has impeded the growth of many industries, the real estate market in <this country> is yet to be negatively impacted. <this country>ese real estate has become one of the safest investments for foreign investors around the world.As of 2020, the Greater <this city> Area is the world's largest urban area with over 38 million residents, making it as its largest metro area.\n\nGallery\n\nGeography and government\nThe mainland portion of <this city> lies northwest of <this city> Bay and measures about 90 km (56 mi) east to west and 25 km (16 mi) north to south. The average elevation in <this city> is 40 m (131 ft). Chiba Prefecture borders it to the east, Yamanashi to the west, Kanagawa to the south, and Saitama to the north. Mainland <this city> is further subdivided into the special wards (occupying the eastern half) and the Tama area (\u591a\u6469\u5730\u57df) stretching westwards. <this city> has a latitude of 35.65 (near the 36th parallel north), which makes it more southern than Rome (41.90), Madrid (40.41), New York City (40.71) and Beijing (39.91).Within the administrative boundaries of <this city> Metropolis are two island chains in the Pacific Ocean directly south: the Izu Islands, and the Ogasawara Islands, which stretch more than 1,000 km (620 mi) away from the mainland. Because of these islands and the mountainous regions to the west, <this city>'s overall population density figures far under-represent the real figures for the urban and suburban regions of <this city>.Under <this country>ese law, the prefecture of <this city> is designated as a to (\u90fd), translated as metropolis. <this city> Prefecture is the most populous prefecture and the densest, with 6,100 inhabitants per square kilometer (16,000/sq mi); by geographic area it is the third-smallest, above only Osaka and Kagawa. Its administrative structure is similar to that of <this country>'s other prefectures. The 23 special wards (\u7279\u5225\u533a, tokubetsu-ku), which until 1943 constituted the city of <this city>, are self-governing municipalities, each having a mayor, a council, and the status of a city.\nIn addition to these 23 special wards, <this city> also includes 26 more cities (\u5e02 -shi), five towns (\u753a -ch\u014d or machi), and eight villages (\u6751 -son or -mura), each of which has a local government. The <this city> Metropolitan Government administers the whole metropolis including the 23 special wards and the cities and towns that constitute the prefecture. It is headed by a publicly elected governor and metropolitan assembly. Its headquarters is in Shinjuku Ward.\n\nMunicipalities\nSince 2001, <this city> consists of 62 municipalities: 23 special wards, 26 cities, 5 towns and 8 villages. Any municipality of <this country> has a directly elected mayor and a directly elected assembly, each elected on independent four-year cycles. 23 of <this city>'s municipalities cover the area that had been <this city> City until WWII, 30 remain today in the Tama area (former North Tama, West Tama and South Tama districts), 9 on <this city>'s outlying islands.\n\nThe special wards (\u7279\u5225\u533a, tokubetsu-ku) of <this city> comprise the area formerly incorporated as <this city> City. The special wards use the word \"city\" in their official English name (e.g. Chiyoda City). The wards differ from other cities in having a unique administrative relationship with the prefectural government. Certain municipal functions, such as waterworks, sewerage, and fire-fighting, are handled by the <this city> Metropolitan Government. To pay for the added administrative costs, the prefecture collects municipal taxes, which would usually be levied by the city. The \"three central wards\" of <this city> \u2013 Chiyoda, Ch\u016b\u014d and Minato \u2013 are the business core of the city, with a daytime population more than seven times higher than their nighttime population. Chiyoda Ward is unique in that it is in the very heart of the former <this city> City, yet is one of the least populated wards. It is occupied by many major <this country>ese companies and is also the seat of the national government, and the <this country>ese emperor. It is often called the \"political center\" of the country. Akihabara, known for being an otaku cultural center and a shopping district for computer goods, is also in Chiyoda.\nTo the west of the special wards, <this city> Metropolis consists of cities, towns, and villages that enjoy the same legal status as those elsewhere in <this country>. While serving as \"bed towns\" for those working in central <this city>, some of them also have a local commercial and industrial base, such as Tachikawa. Collectively, these are often known as the Tama area or Western <this city>. The far west of the Tama area is occupied by the district (gun) of Nishi-Tama. Much of this area is mountainous and unsuitable for urbanization. The highest mountain in <this city>, Mount Kumotori, is 2,017 m (6,617 ft) high; other mountains in <this city> include Takanosu (1,737 m (5,699 ft)), Odake (1,266 m (4,154 ft)), and Mitake (929 m (3,048 ft)). Lake Okutama, on the Tama River near Yamanashi Prefecture, is <this city>'s largest lake. The district is composed of three towns (Hinode, Mizuho and Okutama) and one village (Hinohara). The <this city> Metropolitan Government has designated Hachi\u014dji, Tachikawa, Machida, \u014cme and Tama New Town as regional centers of the Tama area, as part of its plans to relocate urban functions away from central <this city>.\n<this city> has numerous outlying islands, which extend as far as 1,850 km (1,150 mi) from central <this city>. Because of the islands' distance from the administrative headquarters of the <this city> Metropolitan Government in Shinjuku, local subprefectural branch offices administer them. The Izu Islands are a group of volcanic islands and form part of the Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park. The islands in order from closest to <this city> are Izu \u014cshima, Toshima, Nii-jima, Shikine-jima, K\u014dzu-shima, Miyake-jima, Mikurajima, Hachij\u014d-jima, and Aogashima. The Izu Islands are grouped into three subprefectures. Izu \u014cshima and Hachijojima are towns. The remaining islands are six villages, with Niijima and Shikinejima forming one village. The Ogasawara Islands include, from north to south, Chichi-jima, Nishinoshima, Haha-jima, Kita Iwo Jima, Iwo Jima, and Minami Iwo Jima. Ogasawara also administers two tiny outlying islands: Minami Torishima, the easternmost point in <this country> and at 1,850 km (1,150 mi) the most distant island from central <this city>, and Okinotorishima, the southernmost point in <this country>. <this country>'s claim on an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) surrounding Okinotorishima is contested by China and South Korea as they regard Okinotorishima as uninhabitable rocks which have no EEZ. The Iwo chain and the outlying islands have no permanent population, but hosts <this country> Self-Defense Forces personnel. Local populations are only found on Chichi-Jima and Haha-Jima. The islands form both Ogasawara Subprefecture and the village of Ogasawara, <this city>.\n\nMunicipal mergers\nWhen <this city> reached its current extent except for smaller border changes in 1893, it consisted of over 170 municipalities, 1 (by definition: district-independent) city, nine districts with their towns and villages, plus the island communities that had never part of ritsury\u014d districts. By 1953, the number of municipalities had dropped to 97. The current total of 62 was reached in 2001.\n\nNational parks\nAs of March 31, 2008, 36% of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as Natural Parks (second only to Shiga Prefecture), namely the Chichibu Tama Kai, Fuji-Hakone-Izu, and Ogasawara National Parks (the last a UNESCO World Heritage Site); Meiji no Mori Takao Quasi-National Park; and Akikawa Ky\u016bry\u014d, Hamura Kusabana Ky\u016bry\u014d, Sayama, Takao Jinba, Takiyama, and Tama Ky\u016bry\u014d Prefectural Natural Parks.A number of museums are located in Ueno Park: <this city> National Museum, National Museum of Nature and Science, Shitamachi Museum and National Museum for Western Art, among others. There are also artworks and statues at several places in the park. There is also a zoo in the park, and the park is a popular destination to view cherry blossoms.\n\nEarthquakes\nMinor quakes\n<this city> is near the boundary of three plates, making it an extremely active region for smaller quakes and slippage which frequently affect the urban area with swaying as if in a boat, although epicenters within mainland <this city> (excluding <this city>'s 2,000 km (1,243 mi)\u2013long island jurisdiction) are quite rare. It is not uncommon in the metro area to have hundreds of these minor quakes (magnitudes 4\u20136) that can be felt in a single year, something local residents merely brush off but can be a source of anxiety not only for foreign visitors but for <this country>ese from elsewhere as well. They rarely cause much damage (sometimes a few injuries) as they are either too small or far away as quakes tend to dance around the region. Particularly active are offshore regions and to a lesser extent Chiba and Ibaraki.\n\nInfrequent powerful quakes\n<this city> has been hit by powerful megathrust earthquakes in 1703, 1782, 1812, 1855, 1923, and much more indirectly (with some liquefaction in landfill zones) in 2011; the frequency of direct and large quakes is a relative rarity. The 1923 earthquake, with an estimated magnitude of 8.3, killed 142,000 people, the last time the urban area was directly hit.\n\nVolcanic eruptions\nMount Fuji is about 100 km (62 mi) southwest of <this city>. There is a low risk of eruption. The last recorded was the H\u014dei eruption which started on December 16, 1707, and ended about January 1, 1708 (16 days). During the H\u014dei eruption, the ash amount was 4 cm in southern <this city> (bay area) and 2 cm to 0.5 cm in central <this city>. Kanagawa had 16 cm to 8 cm ash and Saitama 0.5 to 0 cm. If the wind blows north-east it could send volcanic ash to <this city> metropolis. According to the government, less than a millimeter of the volcanic ash from a Mount Fuji eruption could cause power grid problems such as blackouts and stop trains in the <this city> metropolitan area. A mixture of ash with rain could stick to cellphone antennas, power lines and cause temporary power outages. The affected areas would need to be evacuated.\n\nWater management\n<this city> is located on the Kant\u014d Plain with five river systems and dozens of rivers that expand during each season. Important rivers are Edogawa, Nakagawa, Arakawa, Kandagawa, Megurogawa and Tamagawa. In 1947, Typhoon Kathleen struck <this city>, destroying 31,000 homes and killing 1,100 people. In 1958, Typhoon Ida dropped 400 mm (16 in) of rain in a single week, causing streets to flood. In the 1950s and 1960s, the government invested 6\u20137% of the national budget on disaster and risk reduction. A huge system of dams, levees and tunnels was constructed. The purpose is to manage heavy rain, typhonic rain, and river floods.<this city> has currently the world's largest underground floodwater diversion facility called the Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel (MAOUDC). It took 13 years to build and was completed in 2006. The MAOUDC is a 6.3 km (3.9 mi) long system of tunnels, 22 meters (72 ft) underground, with 70-meter (230 ft) tall cylindrical tanks, each tank being large enough to fit a space shuttle or the Statue of Liberty. During floods, excess water is collected from rivers and drained to the Edo River. Low-lying areas of K\u014dt\u014d, Edogawa, Sumida, Katsushika, Tait\u014d and Arakawa near the Arakawa River are most at risk of flooding.\n\nClimate\nThe former city of <this city> and the majority of <this city> prefecture lie in the humid subtropical climate zone (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Cfa), with hot, humid summers and mild to cool winters with occasional cold spells. The region, like much of <this country>, experiences a one-month seasonal lag. The warmest month is August, which averages 26.9 \u00b0C (80.4 \u00b0F). The coolest month is January, averaging 5.4 \u00b0C (41.7 \u00b0F). The record low temperature was \u22129.2 \u00b0C (15.4 \u00b0F) on January 13, 1876. The record high was 39.5 \u00b0C (103.1 \u00b0F) on July 20, 2004. \nThe record highest low temperature is 30.3 \u00b0C (86.5 \u00b0F), on August 12, 2013, making <this city> one of only seven observation sites in <this country> that have recorded a low temperature over 30 \u00b0C (86.0 \u00b0F).Annual rainfall averages nearly 1,600 millimeters (63.0 in), with a wetter summer and a drier winter. The growing season in <this city> lasts for about 322 days from around mid-February to early January. Snowfall is sporadic, and occurs almost annually. <this city> often sees typhoons every year, though few are strong. The wettest month since records began in 1876 was October 2004, with 780 millimeters (30 in) of rain, including 270.5 mm (10.65 in) on the ninth of that month. The most recent of four months on record to observe no precipitation is December 1995. Annual precipitation has ranged from 879.5 mm (34.63 in) in 1984 to 2,229.6 mm (87.78 in) in 1938.\n\nSee or edit raw graph data.\n<this city> has experienced significant warming of its climate since temperature records began in 1876.\n\nThe western mountainous area of mainland <this city>, Okutama also lies in the humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen classification: Cfa).\n\nThe climates of <this city>'s offshore territories vary significantly from those of the city. The climate of Chichijima in Ogasawara village is on the boundary between the tropical savanna climate (K\u00f6ppen classification: Aw) and the tropical rainforest climate (K\u00f6ppen classification: Af). It is approximately 1,000 km (621 mi) south of the Greater <this city> Area, resulting in much different climatic conditions.\n\n<this city>'s easternmost territory, the island of Minamitorishima in Ogasawara village, is in the tropical savanna climate zone (K\u00f6ppen classification: Aw). <this city>'s Izu and Ogasawara islands are affected by an average of 5.4 typhoons a year, compared to 3.1 in mainland Kant\u014d.\n\nCityscape\nArchitecture in <this city> has largely been shaped by <this city>'s history. Twice in recent history has the metropolis been left in ruins: first in the 1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake and later after extensive firebombing in World War II. Because of this, <this city>'s urban landscape consists mainly of modern and contemporary architecture, and older buildings are scarce. <this city> features many internationally famous forms of modern architecture including <this city> International Forum, Asahi Beer Hall, Mode Gakuen Cocoon Tower, NTT Docomo Yoyogi Building and Rainbow Bridge. <this city> features two distinctive towers: <this city> Tower and <this city> Skytree, the latter of which is the tallest tower in both <this country> and the world, and the second tallest structure in the world after the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. Mori Building Co started work on <this city>'s new tallest building which is set to be finished in March 2023. The project will cost 580 billion yen ($5.5 billion).<this city> contains numerous parks and gardens. There are four national parks in <this city> Prefecture, including the Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park, which includes all of the Izu Islands.\n\nEnvironment\n<this city> has enacted a measure to cut greenhouse gases. Governor Shintaro Ishihara created <this country>'s first emissions cap system, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emission by a total of 25% by 2020 from the 2000 level. <this city> is an example of an urban heat island, and the phenomenon is especially serious in its special wards.

During the centralized growth of <this country>'s economy following World War II, many large firms moved their headquarters from cities such as Osaka (the historical commercial capital) to <this city>, in an attempt to take advantage of better access to the government. This trend has begun to slow due to ongoing population growth in <this city> and the high cost of living there.\n<this city> was rated by the Economist Intelligence Unit as the most expensive (highest cost-of-living) city in the world for 14 years in a row ending in 2006, when it was replaced by Oslo, and later Paris.<this city> emerged as a leading international financial center (IFC) in the 1960s and has been described as one of the three \"command centers\" for the world economy, along with New York City and London.

The <this country>ese financial market opened up slowly in 1984 and accelerated its internationalization with the \"<this country>ese Big Bang\" in 1998.
