  "wiki_text": "<this city> (; Hebrew: \u05d9\u05b0\u05e8\u05d5\u05bc\u05e9\u05b8\u05c1\u05dc\u05b7\u05d9\u05b4\u05dd Yerushal\u00e1yim; Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0642\u064f\u062f\u0633, al-Quds, Arabic pronunciation: [al.quds] (listen), local pronunciation: [il.\u0294uds]) is a city in Western Asia, on a plateau in the Judaean Mountains between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. It is one of the oldest cities in the world, and is considered holy to the three major Abrahamic religions\u2014Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Both <this country>is and Palestinians claim <this city> as their capital, as <this country> maintains its primary governmental institutions there and the State of Palestine ultimately foresees it as its seat of power. Neither claim, however, is widely recognized internationally.Throughout its long history, <this city> has been destroyed at least twice, besieged 23 times, captured and recaptured 44 times, and attacked 52 times. The part of <this city> called the City of David shows first signs of settlement in the 4th millennium BCE, in the shape of encampments of nomadic shepherds. During the Canaanite period (14th century BCE), <this city> was named as Urusalim on ancient Egyptian tablets, probably meaning \"City of Shalem\" after a Canaanite deity. During the <this country>ite period, significant construction activity in <this city> began in the 9th century BCE (Iron Age II), and by the 8th century BCE, the city had developed into the religious and administrative centre of the Kingdom of Judah. In 1538, the city walls were rebuilt for a last time around <this city> under Suleiman the Magnificent of the Ottoman Empire. Today those walls define the Old City, which since the 19th century has been divided into four quarters \u2013 the Armenian, Christian, Jewish, and Muslim quarters. The Old City became a World Heritage Site in 1981, and is on the List of World Heritage in Danger. Since 1860, <this city> has grown far beyond the Old City's boundaries. In 2022, <this city> had a population of some 971,800 residents, of which almost 60% were Jews and almost 40% Palestinians. In 2020, the population was 951,100, of which Jews comprised 570,100 (59.9%), Muslims 353,800 (37.2%), Christians 16,300 (1.7%), and 10,800 unclassified (1.1%).According to the Hebrew Bible, King David conquered the city from the Jebusites and established it as the capital of the United Kingdom of <this country>, and his son, King Solomon, commissioned the building of the First Temple. Modern scholars argue that Jews branched out of the Canaanite peoples and culture through the development of a distinct monolatrous\u2014and later monotheistic\u2014religion centred on El/Yahweh. These foundational events, straddling the dawn of the 1st millennium BCE, assumed central symbolic importance for the Jewish people. The sobriquet of holy city (Hebrew: \u05e2\u05d9\u05e8 \u05d4\u05e7\u05d5\u05d3\u05e9, romanized: 'Ir ha-Qodesh) was probably attached to <this city> in post-exilic times. The holiness of <this city> in Christianity, conserved in the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, which Christians adopted as their own \"Old Testament\", was reinforced by the New Testament account of Jesus's crucifixion and resurrection there. In Sunni Islam, <this city> is the third-holiest city, after Mecca and Medina. The city was the first qibla, the standard direction for Muslim prayers (salah), and in Islamic tradition, Muhammad made his Night Journey there in 621, ascending to heaven where he speaks to God, according to the Quran. As a result, despite having an area of only 0.9 km2 (3\u20448 sq mi), the Old City is home to many sites of seminal religious importance, among them the Temple Mount with its Western Wall, Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa Mosque, and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.\nToday, the status of <this city> remains one of the core issues in the <this country>i\u2013Palestinian conflict. During the 1948 Arab\u2013<this country>i War, West <this city> was among the areas captured and later annexed by <this country> while East <this city>, including the Old City, was captured and later annexed by Jordan. <this country> captured East <this city> from Jordan during the 1967 Six-Day War and subsequently effectively annexed it into <this city>, together with additional surrounding territory. One of <this country>'s Basic Laws, the 1980 <this city> Law, refers to <this city> as the country's undivided capital. All branches of the <this country>i government are located in <this city>, including the Knesset (<this country>'s parliament), the residences of the Prime Minister (Beit Aghion) and President (Beit HaNassi), and the Supreme Court. The international community rejects the annexation as illegal and regards East <this city> as Palestinian territory occupied by <this country>.\n\nEtymology and names\nEtymology\nThe name \"<this city>\" is variously etymologized to mean \"foundation (Semitic yry' 'to found, to lay a cornerstone') of the god Shalem\"; the god Shalem was thus the original tutelary deity of the Bronze Age city.Shalim or Shalem was the name of the god of dusk in the Canaanite religion, whose name is based on the same root S-L-M from which the Hebrew word for \"peace\" is derived (Shalom in Hebrew, cognate with Arabic Salam). The name thus offered itself to etymologizations such as \"The City of Peace\", \"Abode of Peace\", \"Dwelling of Peace\" (\"founded in safety\"), or \"Vision of Peace\" in some Christian authors.The ending -ayim indicates the dual, thus leading to the suggestion that the name Yerushalayim refers to the fact that the city initially sat on two hills.\n\nAncient Egyptian sources\nThe Execration Texts of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt (c. 19th century BCE), which refer to a city called rw\u0161\ua723lmm or \ua723w\u0161\ua723mm, variously transcribed as Ru\u0161alimum, Uru\u0161alimum or R\u00f4sh-ramen, may indicate <this city>. Alternatively, the Amarna letters of Abdi-Heba (1330s BCE), which reference an \u00daru\u0161alim, may be the earliest mention of the city.\n\nHebrew Bible and Jewish sources\nThe form Yerushalem or Yerushalayim first appears in the Bible, in the Book of Joshua. According to a Midrash, the name is a combination of two names united by God, Yireh (\"the abiding place\", the name given by Abraham to the place where he planned to sacrifice his son) and Shalem (\"Place of Peace\", the name given by high priest Shem).\n\nOldest written mention of <this city>\nOne of the earliest extra-biblical Hebrew writing of the word <this city> is dated to the sixth or seventh century BCE and was discovered in Khirbet Beit Lei near Beit Guvrin in 1961. The inscription states: \"I am Yahweh thy God, I will accept the cities of Judah and I will redeem <this city>\", or as other scholars suggest: \"Yahweh is the God of the whole earth. The mountains of Judah belong to him, to the God of <this city>\". An older example on papyrus is known from the previous century.\nIn extra-biblical inscriptions, the earliest known example of the -ayim ending was discovered on a column about 3 km west of ancient <this city>, dated to the first century BCE.\n\nJebus, Zion, City of David\nAn ancient settlement of <this city>, founded as early as the Bronze Age on the hill above the Gihon Spring, was, according to the Bible, named Jebus. Called the \"Fortress of Zion\" (metsudat Zion), it was renamed as the \"City of David\", and was known by this name in antiquity. Another name, \"Zion\", initially referred to a distinct part of the city, but later came to signify the city as a whole, and afterwards to represent the whole biblical Land of <this country>.\n\nGreek, Roman and Byzantine names\nIn Greek and Latin, the city's name was transliterated Hierosolyma (Greek: \u1f39\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03cc\u03bb\u03c5\u03bc\u03b1; in Greek hier\u00f2s, \u1f31\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2, means holy), although the city was renamed Aelia Capitolina for part of the Roman period of its history.\n\nSalem\nThe Aramaic Apocryphon of Genesis of the Dead Sea Scrolls (1QapGen 22:13) equates <this city> with the earlier \"Salem\" (\u05e9\u05dc\u05dd), said to be the kingdom of Melchizedek in Genesis 14. Other early Hebrew sources, early Christian renderings of the verse and targumim, however, put Salem in Northern <this country> near Shechem (Sichem), now Nablus, a city of some importance in early sacred Hebrew writing. Possibly the redactor of the Apocryphon of Genesis wanted to dissociate Melchizedek from the area of Shechem, which at the time was in possession of the Samaritans. However that may be, later Rabbinic sources also equate Salem with <this city>, mainly to link Melchizedek to later Temple traditions.\n\nArabic names\nIn Arabic, <this city> is most commonly known as \u0627\u0644\u0642\u064f\u062f\u0633, transliterated as al-Quds and meaning \"The Holy\" or \"The Holy Sanctuary\", cognate with Hebrew: \u05d4\u05e7\u05d3\u05e9, romanized: Ha-Qodesh, lit.\u2009'The Holy'. The \u0642 (Q) is pronounced either with a voiceless uvular plosive (/q/), as in Classical Arabic, or with a glottal stop (\u0294) as in Levantine Arabic. Official <this country>i government policy mandates that \u0623\u064f\u0648\u0631\u064f\u0634\u064e\u0644\u0650\u064a\u0645\u064e, transliterated as \u016ar\u0161al\u012bm, which is the cognate of the Hebrew and English names, be used as the Arabic language name for the city in conjunction with \u0627\u0644\u0642\u064f\u062f\u0633. \u0623\u064f\u0648\u0631\u064f\u0634\u064e\u0644\u0650\u064a\u0645\u064e-\u0627\u0644\u0642\u064f\u062f\u0633. Palestinian Arab families who hail from this city are often called \"Qudsi\" or \"Maqdisi\", while Palestinian Muslim <this city>ites may use these terms as a demonym.\n\nHistory\nGiven the city's central position in both Jewish nationalism (Zionism) and Palestinian nationalism, the selectivity required to summarize some 5,000 years of inhabited history is often influenced by ideological bias or background. <this country>i or Jewish nationalists claim a right to the city based on Jewish indigeneity to the land, particularly their origins in and descent from the <this country>ites, for whom <this city> is their capital, and their yearning for return. In contrast, Palestinian nationalists claim the right to the city based on modern Palestinians' longstanding presence and descent from many different peoples who have settled or lived in the region over the centuries. Both sides claim the history of the city has been politicized by the other in order to strengthen their relative claims to the city, and that this is borne out by the different focuses the different writers place on the various events and eras in the city's history.\n\nOverview of <this city>'s historical periods (by rulers)\nPrehistory\nThe first archaeological evidence of human presence in the area comes in the form of flints dated to between 6000 and 7000 years ago, with ceramic remains appearing during the Chalcolithic period, and the first signs of permanent settlement appearing in the Early Bronze Age in 3000\u20132800 BCE.\n\nBronze and Iron Ages\nThe earliest evidence of city fortifications appear in the Mid to Late Bronze Age and could date to around the 18th century BCE. By around 1550\u20131200 BCE, <this city> was the capital of an Egyptian vassal city-state, a modest settlement governing a few outlying villages and pastoral areas, with a small Egyptian garrison and ruled by appointees such as king Abdi-Heba, At the time of Seti I (r. 1290\u20131279 BCE) and Ramesses II (r. 1279\u20131213 BCE), major construction took place as prosperity increased. The city's inhabitants at this time were Canaanites, who are believed by scholars to have evolved into the <this country>ites via the development of a distinct Yahweh-centric monotheistic belief system.\nArchaeological remains from the ancient <this country>ite period include the Siloam Tunnel, an aqueduct built by Judahite king Hezekiah and once containing an ancient Hebrew inscription, known as the Siloam Inscription; the so-called Broad Wall, a defensive fortification built in the 8th century BCE, also by Hezekiah; the Silwan necropolis (9th\u20137th c. BCE) with the Monolith of Silwan and the Tomb of the Royal Steward, which were decorated with monumental Hebrew inscriptions; and the so-called <this country>ite Tower, remnants of ancient fortifications, built from large, sturdy rocks with carved cornerstones. A huge water reservoir dating from this period was discovered in 2012 near Robinson's Arch, indicating the existence of a densely built-up quarter across the area west of the Temple Mount during the Kingdom of Judah.When the Assyrians conquered the Kingdom of <this country> in 722 BCE, <this city> was strengthened by a great influx of refugees from the northern kingdom. When Hezekiah ruled, <this city> had no fewer than 25,000 inhabitants and covered 25 acres (10 hectares).In 587\u2013586 BCE, Nebuchadnezzar II of the Neo-Babylonian Empire conquered <this city> after a prolonged siege, and then systematically destroyed the city, including Solomon's Temple. The Kingdom of Judah was abolished and many were exiled to Babylon. These events mark the end of the First Temple period.\n\nBiblical account\nThis period, when Canaan formed part of the Egyptian empire, corresponds in biblical accounts to Joshua's invasion, but almost all scholars agree that the Book of Joshua holds little historical value for early <this country>.\nIn the Bible, <this city> is defined as lying within territory allocated to the tribe of Benjamin though still inhabited by Jebusites. David is said to have conquered these in the siege of Jebus, and transferred his capital from Hebron to <this city> which then became the capital of a United Kingdom of <this country>, and one of its several religious centres. The choice was perhaps dictated by the fact that <this city> did not form part of <this country>'s tribal system, and was thus suited to serve as the centre of its confederation. Opinion is divided over whether the so-called Large Stone Structure and the nearby Stepped Stone Structure may be identified with King David's palace, or dates to a later period.According to the Bible, King David reigned for 40 years and was succeeded by his son Solomon, who built the Holy Temple on Mount Moriah. Solomon's Temple (later known as the First Temple), went on to play a pivotal role in Jewish religion as the repository of the Ark of the Covenant. On Solomon's death, ten of the northern tribes of <this country> broke with the United Monarchy to form their own nation, with its kings, prophets, priests, traditions relating to religion, capitals and temples in northern <this country>. The southern tribes, together with the Aaronid priesthood, remained in <this city>, with the city becoming the capital of the Kingdom of Judah.\n\nClassical antiquity\nSecond Temple period\nIn 538 BCE, the Persian King Cyrus the Great invited the Jews of Babylon to return to Judah to rebuild the Temple. Construction of the Second Temple was completed in 516 BCE, during the reign of Darius the Great, 70 years after the destruction of the First Temple.Sometime soon after 485 BCE <this city> was besieged, conquered and largely destroyed by a coalition of neighbouring states. In about 445 BCE, King Artaxerxes I of Persia issued a decree allowing the city (including its walls) to be rebuilt. <this city> resumed its role as capital of Judah and centre of Jewish worship.\n\nMany Jewish tombs from the Second Temple period have been unearthed in <this city>. One example, discovered north of the Old City, contains human remains in a 1st-century CE ossuary decorated with the Aramaic inscription \"Simon the Temple Builder\". The Tomb of Abba, also located north of the Old City, bears an Aramaic inscription with Paleo-Hebrew letters reading: \"I, Abba, son of the priest Eleaz(ar), son of Aaron the high (priest), Abba, the oppressed and the persecuted, who was born in <this city>, and went into exile into Babylonia and brought (back to <this city>) Mattathi(ah), son of Jud(ah), and buried him in a cave which I bought by deed.\" The Tomb of Benei Hezir located in Kidron Valley is decorated by monumental Doric columns and Hebrew inscription, identifying it as the burial site of Second Temple priests. The Tombs of the Sanhedrin, an underground complex of 63 rock-cut tombs, is located in a public park in the northern <this city> neighbourhood of Sanhedria. These tombs, probably reserved for members of the Sanhedrin and inscribed by ancient Hebrew and Aramaic writings, are dated to between 100 BCE and 100 CE.\nWhen Alexander the Great conquered the Persian Empire, <this city> and Judea came under Macedonian control, eventually falling to the Ptolemaic dynasty under Ptolemy I. In 198 BCE, Ptolemy V Epiphanes lost <this city> and Judea to the Seleucids under Antiochus III. The Seleucid attempt to recast <this city> as a Hellenized city-state came to a head in 168 BCE with the successful Maccabean revolt of Mattathias and his five sons against Antiochus IV Epiphanes, and their establishment of the Hasmonean Kingdom in 152 BCE with <this city> as its capital.\nIn 63 BCE, Pompey the Great intervened in a struggle for the Hasmonean throne and captured <this city>, extending the influence of the Roman Republic over Judea. Following a short invasion by Parthians, backing the rival Hasmonean rulers, Judea became a scene of struggle between pro-Roman and pro-Parthian forces, eventually leading to the emergence of an Edomite named Herod. As Rome became stronger, it installed Herod as a client king of the Jews. Herod the Great, as he was known, devoted himself to developing and beautifying the city. He built walls, towers and palaces, and expanded the Temple Mount, buttressing the courtyard with blocks of stone weighing up to 100 tons. Under Herod, the area of the Temple Mount doubled in size. Shortly after Herod's death, in 6 CE Judea came under direct Roman rule as the Iudaea Province, although the Herodian dynasty through Agrippa II remained client kings of neighbouring territories until 96 CE.\n\nRoman rule over <this city> and Judea was challenged in the First Jewish\u2013Roman War (66\u201373 CE), which ended with a Roman victory. Early on, the city was devastated by a brutal civil war between several Jewish factions fighting for control of the city. In 70 CE, the Romans destroyed <this city> and the Second Temple. The contemporary Jewish historian Josephus wrote that the city \"was so thoroughly razed to the ground by those that demolished it to its foundations, that nothing was left that could ever persuade visitors that it had once been a place of habitation.\" Of the 600,000 (Tacitus) or 1,000,000 (Josephus) Jews of <this city>, all of them either died of starvation, were killed or were sold into slavery. Roman rule was again challenged during the Bar Kokhba revolt, beginning in 132 CE and suppressed by the Romans in 135 CE. More recent research indicates that the Romans had founded Aelia Capitolina before the outbreak of the revolt, and found no evidence for Bar Kokhba ever managing to hold the city.<this city> reached a peak in size and population at the end of the Second Temple Period, when the city covered two km2 (3\u20444 sq mi) and had a population of 200,000.\n\nLate Antiquity\nFollowing the Bar Kokhba revolt, Emperor Hadrian combined Iudaea Province with neighbouring provinces under the new name of Syria Palaestina, replacing the name of Judea. The city was renamed Aelia Capitolina, and rebuilt it in the style of a typical Roman town. Jews were prohibited from entering the city on pain of death, except for one day each year, during the holiday of Tisha B'Av. Taken together, these measures (which also affected Jewish Christians) essentially \"secularized\" the city. Historical sources and archaeological evidence indicate that the rebuilt city was now inhabited by veterans of the Roman military and immigrants from the western parts of the empire.The ban against Jews was maintained until the 7th century, though Christians would soon be granted an exemption: during the 4th century, the Roman emperor Constantine I ordered the construction of Christian holy sites in the city, including the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Burial remains from the Byzantine period are exclusively Christian, suggesting that the population of <this city> in Byzantine times probably consisted only of Christians.\nIn the 5th century, the eastern continuation of the Roman Empire, ruled from the recently renamed Constantinople, maintained control of the city. Within the span of a few decades, <this city> shifted from Byzantine to Persian rule, then back to Roman-Byzantine dominion. Following Sassanid Khosrau II's early 7th century push through Syria, his generals Shahrbaraz and Shahin attacked <this city> (Persian: Dej Houdkh) aided by the Jews of Palaestina Prima, who had risen up against the Byzantines.In the Siege of <this city> of 614, after 21 days of relentless siege warfare, <this city> was captured. Byzantine chronicles relate that the Sassanids and Jews slaughtered tens of thousands of Christians in the city, many at the Mamilla Pool, and destroyed their monuments and churches, including the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. This episode has been the subject of much debate between historians. The conquered city would remain in Sassanid hands for some fifteen years until the Byzantine emperor Heraclius reconquered it in 629.\n\nMiddle Ages\nEarly Muslim period\nByzantine <this city> was conquered by the Arab armies of Umar ibn al-Khattab in 638 CE. Among the first Muslims, it was referred to as Madinat bayt al-Maqdis (\"City of the Temple\"), a name restricted to the Temple Mount. The rest of the city \"was called Iliya, reflecting the Roman name given the city following the destruction of 70 CE: Aelia Capitolina\". Later the Temple Mount became known as al-Haram al-Sharif, \"The Noble Sanctuary\", while the city around it became known as Bayt al-Maqdis, and later still, al-Quds al-Sharif \"The Holy, Noble\". The Islamization of <this city> began in the first year A.H. (623 CE), when Muslims were instructed to face the city while performing their daily prostrations and, according to Muslim religious tradition, Muhammad's night journey and ascension to heaven took place. After 13 years, the direction of prayer was changed to Mecca. In 638 CE the Islamic Caliphate extended its dominion to <this city>. With the Arab conquest, Jews were allowed back into the city. The Rashidun caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab signed a treaty with Christian Patriarch of <this city> Sophronius, assuring him that <this city>'s Christian holy places and population would be protected under Muslim rule. Christian-Arab tradition records that, when led to pray at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, one of the holiest sites for Christians, the caliph Umar refused to pray in the church so that Muslims would not request conversion of the church to a mosque. He prayed outside the church, where the Mosque of Umar (Omar) stands to this day, opposite the entrance to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. According to the Gaullic bishop Arculf, who lived in <this city> from 679 to 688, the Mosque of Umar was a rectangular wooden structure built over ruins which could accommodate 3,000 worshipers.\nWhen the Arab armies under Umar went to Bayt Al-Maqdes in 637 CE, they searched for the site of al-masjid al-aqsa, \"the farthest place of prayer/mosque\", that was mentioned in the Quran and Hadith according to Islamic beliefs. Contemporary Arabic and Hebrew sources say the site was full of rubbish, and that Arabs and Jews cleaned it. The Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik commissioned the construction of a shrine on the Temple Mount, now known as the Dome of the Rock, in the late 7th century. Two of the city's most-distinguished Arab citizens of the 10th-century were Al-Muqaddasi, the geographer, and Al-Tamimi, the physician. Al-Muqaddasi writes that Abd al-Malik built the edifice on the Temple Mount in order to compete in grandeur with <this city>'s monumental churches.Over the next four hundred years, <this city>'s prominence diminished as Arab powers in the region vied for control of the city. <this city> was captured in 1073 by the Seljuk Turkish commander Ats\u0131z. After Ats\u0131z was killed, the Seljuk prince Tutush I granted the city to Artuk Bey, another Seljuk commander. After Artuk's death in 1091 his sons S\u00f6kmen and Ilghazi governed in the city up to 1098 when the Fatimids recaptured the city.\nA messianic Karaite movement to gather in <this city> took place at the turn of the millennium, leading to a \"Golden Age\" of Karaite scholarship there, which was only terminated by the Crusades.\n\nCrusader/Ayyubid period\nIn 1099, the Fatimid ruler expelled the native Christian population before <this city> was besieged by the soldiers of the First Crusade. After taking the solidly defended city by assault, the Crusaders massacred most of its Muslim and Jewish inhabitants, and made it the capital of their Kingdom of <this city>. The city, which had been virtually emptied, was recolonized by a variegated inflow of Greeks, Bulgarians, Hungarians, Georgians, Armenians, Syrians, Egyptians, Nestorians, Maronites, Jacobite Miaphysites, Copts and others, to block the return of the surviving Muslims and Jews. The north-eastern quarter was repopulated with Eastern Christians from the Transjordan. As a result, by 1099 <this city>'s population had climbed back to some 30,000.In 1187, the city was wrested from the Crusaders by Saladin who permitted Jews and Muslims to return and settle in the city. Under the terms of surrender, once ransomed, 60,000 Franks were expelled. The Eastern Christian populace was permitted to stay. Under the Ayyubid dynasty of Saladin, a period of huge investment began in the construction of houses, markets, public baths, and pilgrim hostels as well as the establishment of religious endowments. However, for most of the 13th century, <this city> declined to the status of a village due to city's fall of strategic value and Ayyubid internecine struggles.From 1229 to 1244, <this city> peacefully reverted to Christian control as a result of a 1229 treaty agreed between the crusading Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II and al-Kamil, the Ayyubid sultan of Egypt, that ended the Sixth Crusade. The Ayyubids retained control of the Muslim holy places, and Arab sources suggest that Frederick was not permitted to restore <this city>'s fortifications.\nIn 1244, <this city> was sacked by the Khwarezmian Tatars, who decimated the city's Christian population and drove out the Jews. The Khwarezmian Tatars were driven out by the Ayyubids in 1247.\n\nMamluk period\nFrom 1260 to 1516/17, <this city> was ruled by the Mamluks. In the wider region and until around 1300, many clashes occurred between the Mamluks on one side, and the crusaders and the Mongols, on the other side. The area also suffered from many earthquakes and black plague. When Nachmanides visited in 1267 he found only two Jewish families, in a population of 2,000, 300 of whom were Christians, in the city. The well-known and far-traveled lexicographer Fairuzabadi (1329\u20131414) spent ten years in <this city>.\nThe 13th to 15th centuries was a period of frequent building activity in the city, as evidenced by the 90 remaining structures from this time. The city was also a significant site of Mamluk architectural patronage. The types of structures built included madrasas, libraries, hospitals, caravanserais, fountains (or sabils), and public baths. Much of the building activity was concentrated around the edges of the Temple Mount or Haram al-Sharif. Old gates to the Haram lost importance and new gates were built, while significant parts of the northern and western porticoes along the edge of the Temple Mount plaza were built or rebuilt in this period. Tankiz, the Mamluk amir in charge of Syria during the reign of al-Nasir Muhammad, built a new market called Suq al-Qattatin (Cotton Market) in 1336\u20137, along with the gate known as Bab al-Qattanin (Cotton Gate), which gave access to the Temple Mount from this market. The late Mamluk sultan al-Ashraf Qaytbay also took interest in the city. He commissioned the building of the Madrasa al-Ashrafiyya, completed in 1482, and the nearby Sabil of Qaytbay, built shortly after in 1482; both were located on the Temple Mount. Qaytbay's monuments were the last major Mamluk constructions in the city.:\u200a589\u2013612\n\nModern era\nOttoman period (16th\u201319th centuries)\nIn 1517, <this city> and its environs fell to the Ottoman Turks, who generally remained in control until 1917. <this city> enjoyed a prosperous period of renewal and peace under Suleiman the Magnificent\u2014including the rebuilding of magnificent walls around the Old City. Throughout much of Ottoman rule, <this city> remained a provincial, if religiously important centre, and did not straddle the main trade route between Damascus and Cairo. The English reference book Modern history or the present state of all nations, written in 1744, stated that \"<this city> is still reckoned the capital city of Palestine, though much fallen from its ancient grandeaur\".The Ottomans brought many innovations: modern postal systems run by the various consulates and regular stagecoach and carriage services were among the first signs of modernization in the city. In the mid 19th century, the Ottomans constructed the first paved road from Jaffa to <this city>, and by 1892 the railroad had reached the city.With the annexation of <this city> by Muhammad Ali of Egypt in 1831, foreign missions and consulates began to establish a foothold in the city. In 1836, Ibrahim Pasha allowed <this city>'s Jewish residents to restore four major synagogues, among them the Hurva. In the countrywide Peasants' Revolt, Qasim al-Ahmad led his forces from Nablus and attacked <this city>, aided by the Abu Ghosh clan, and entered the city on 31 May 1834. The Christians and Jews of <this city> were subjected to attacks. Ibrahim's Egyptian army routed Qasim's forces in <this city> the following month.\nOttoman rule was reinstated in 1840, but many Egyptian Muslims remained in <this city> and Jews from Algiers and North Africa began to settle in the city in growing numbers. In the 1840s and 1850s, the international powers began a tug-of-war in Palestine as they sought to extend their protection over the region's religious minorities, a struggle carried out mainly through consular representatives in <this city>. According to the Prussian consul, the population in 1845 was 16,410, with 7,120 Jews, 5,000 Muslims, 3,390 Christians, 800 Turkish soldiers and 100 Europeans. The volume of Christian pilgrims increased under the Ottomans, doubling the city's population around Easter time.In the 1860s, new neighbourhoods began to develop outside the Old City walls to house pilgrims and relieve the intense overcrowding and poor sanitation inside the city. The Russian Compound and Mishkenot Sha'ananim were founded in 1860, followed by many others that included Mahane <this country> (1868), Nahalat Shiv'a (1869), German Colony (1872), Beit David (1873), Mea Shearim (1874), Shimon HaZadiq (1876), Beit Ya'aqov (1877), Abu Tor (1880s), American-Swedish Colony (1882), Yemin Moshe (1891), and Mamilla, Wadi al-Joz around the turn of the century. In 1867 an American Missionary reports an estimated population of <this city> of 'above' 15,000, with 4,000 to 5,000 Jews and 6,000 Muslims. Every year there were 5,000 to 6,000 Russian Christian Pilgrims. In 1872 <this city> became the centre of a special administrative district, independent of the Syria Vilayet and under the direct authority of Istanbul called the Mutasarrifate of <this city>.The great number of Christian orphans resulting from the 1860 civil war in Mount Lebanon and the Damascus massacre led in the same year to the opening of the German Protestant Syrian Orphanage, better known as the Schneller Orphanage after its founder. Until the 1880s there were no formal Jewish orphanages in <this city>, as families generally took care of each other. In 1881 the Diskin Orphanage was founded in <this city> with the arrival of Jewish children orphaned by a Russian pogrom. Other orphanages founded in <this city> at the beginning of the 20th century were Zion Blumenthal Orphanage (1900) and General <this country> Orphan's Home for Girls (1902).\n\nJewish immigration to Palestine\nDuring the reign of Sultan Bayezid II (1481\u20131512), the gates of Ottoman Turkey were opened to the Jews expelled from Spain, and in the days of Sultan Selim I, they were allowed to enter the territories he conquered, including Palestine. Rabbi Moses Bassola, who visited Palestine in 1521\u20131522, testified that, largely due to this immigration, the Jewish community in <this city> grew and the deportees from Spain became the majority of the Jewish population in <this city> (which at that time numbered about 300 families).\n\nBritish Mandate (1917\u20131948)\nIn 1917 after the Battle of <this city>, the British Army, led by General Edmund Allenby, captured the city. In 1922, the League of Nations at the Conference of Lausanne entrusted the United Kingdom to administer Palestine, neighbouring Transjordan, and Iraq beyond it.\nFrom 1922 to 1948 the total population of the city rose from 52,000 to 165,000, comprising two-thirds Jews and one-third Arabs (Muslims and Christians). Relations between Arab Christians and Muslims and the growing Jewish population in <this city> deteriorated, resulting in recurring unrest. In <this city>, in particular, Arab riots occurred in 1920 and in 1929. Under the British, new garden suburbs were built in the western and northern parts of the city and institutions of higher learning such as the Hebrew University were founded.\n\nContemporary era\nDivided city: Jordanian and <this country>i rule (1948\u20131967)\nAs the British Mandate for Palestine was expiring, the 1947 UN Partition Plan recommended \"the creation of a special international regime in the City of <this city>, constituting it as a corpus separatum under the administration of the UN.\" The international regime (which also included the city of Bethlehem) was to remain in force for a period of ten years, whereupon a referendum was to be held in which the residents were to decide the future regime of their city. However, this plan was not implemented, as the 1948 war erupted, while the British withdrew from Palestine and <this country> declared its independence.In contradiction to the Partition Plan, which envisioned a city separated from the Arab state and the Jewish state, <this country> took control of the area which later would become West <this city>, along with major parts of the Arab territory allotted to the future Arab State; Jordan took control of East <this city>, along with the West Bank. The war led to displacement of Arab and Jewish populations in the city. The 1,500 residents of the Jewish Quarter of the Old City were expelled and a few hundred taken prisoner when the Arab Legion captured the quarter on 28 May. Arab residents of Katamon, Talbiya, and the German Colony were driven from their homes. By the time of the armistice that ended active fighting, <this country> had control of 12 of <this city>'s 15 Arab residential quarters. An estimated minimum of 30,000 people had become refugees.The war of 1948 resulted in the division of <this city>, so that the old walled city lay entirely on the Jordanian side of the line. A no-man's land between East and West <this city> came into being in November 1948: Moshe Dayan, commander of the <this country>i forces in <this city>, met with his Jordanian counterpart Abdullah el-Tell in a deserted house in <this city>'s Musrara neighbourhood and marked out their respective positions: <this country>'s position in red and Jordan's in green. This rough map, which was not meant as an official one, became the final line in the 1949 Armistice Agreements, which divided the city and left Mount Scopus as an <this country>i exclave inside East <this city>. Barbed wire and concrete barriers ran down the centre of the city, passing close by Jaffa Gate on the western side of the old walled city, and a crossing point was established at Mandelbaum Gate slightly to the north of the old walled city. Military skirmishes frequently threatened the ceasefire.\nAfter the establishment of the state of <this country>, <this city> was declared its capital city. Jordan formally annexed East <this city> in 1950, subjecting it to Jordanian law, and in 1953 declared it the \"second capital\" of Jordan. Only the United Kingdom and Pakistan formally recognized such annexation, which, in regard to <this city>, was on a de facto basis. Some scholars argue that the view that Pakistan recognized Jordan's annexation is dubious.After 1948, since the old walled city in its entirety was to the east of the armistice line, Jordan was able to take control of all the holy places therein. While Muslim holy sites were maintained and renovated, contrary to the terms of the armistice agreement, Jews were denied access to Jewish holy sites, many of which were destroyed or desecrated. Jordan allowed only very limited access to Christian holy sites, and restrictions were imposed on the Christian population that led many to leave the city. Of the 58 synagogues in the Old City, half were either razed or converted to stables and hen-houses over the course of the next 19 years, including the Hurva and the Tiferet Yisrael Synagogue. The 3,000-year-old Mount of Olives Jewish Cemetery was desecrated, with gravestones used to build roads, latrines and Jordanian army fortifications. 38,000 graves in the Jewish Cemetery were destroyed, and Jews were forbidden from being buried there. The Western Wall was transformed into an exclusively Muslim holy site associated with al-Buraq. <this country>i authorities neglected to protect the tombs in the Muslim Mamilla Cemetery in West <this city>, which contains the remains of figures from the early Islamic period, facilitating the creation of a parking lot and public lavatories in 1964. Many other historic and religiously significant buildings were demolished and replaced by modern structures during the Jordanian occupation. During this period, the Dome of the Rock and the Al-Aqsa Mosque underwent major renovations.During the 1948 war, the Jewish residents of Eastern <this city> were expelled by Jordan's Arab Legion. Jordan allowed Arab Palestinian refugees from the war to settle in the vacated Jewish Quarter, which became known as Harat al-Sharaf. In 1966 the Jordanian authorities relocated 500 of them to the Shua'fat refugee camp as part of plans to turn the Jewish quarter into a public park.\n\n<this country>i rule (1967\u2013present)\nIn 1967, the Six-Day War erupted between <this country> and its Arab neighbors. Jordan joined Egypt and attacked <this country>i-held West <this city> on the war's second day. After hand-to-hand fighting between <this country>i and Jordanian soldiers on the Temple Mount, the <this country> Defense Forces occupied East <this city>, along with the entire West Bank. On 27 June 1967, three weeks after the war ended, in what <this country> terms the reunification of <this city>, <this country> extended its law and jurisdiction to East <this city>, including the city's Christian and Muslim holy sites, along with some nearby West Bank territory which comprised 28 Palestinian villages, incorporating it into the <this city> Municipality, although it carefully avoided using the term \"annexation\". On 10 July, Foreign Minister Abba Eban explained to the UN Secretary General: \"The term 'annexation' which was used by supporters of the vote is not accurate. The steps that were taken [by <this country>] relate to the integration of <this city> in administrative and municipal areas, and served as a legal basis for the protection of the holy places of <this city>.\" <this country> conducted a census of Arab residents in the areas annexed. Residents were given permanent residency status and the option of applying for <this country>i citizenship. Since 1967, new Jewish residential areas have mushroomed in the eastern sector, while no new Palestinian neighbourhoods have been created.Jewish and Christian access to the holy sites inside the old walled city was restored. <this country> left the Temple Mount under the jurisdiction of an Islamic waqf, but opened the Western Wall to Jewish access. The Moroccan Quarter, which was located adjacent to the Western Wall, was evacuated and razed to make way for a plaza for those visiting the wall. On 18 April 1968, an expropriation order by the <this country>i Ministry of Finance more than doubled the size of the Jewish Quarter, evicting its Arab residents and seizing over 700 buildings of which 105 belonged to Jewish inhabitants prior to the Jordanian occupation of the city. The order designated these areas for public use, but they were intended for Jews alone. The government offered 200 Jordanian dinars to each displaced Arab family.\nAfter the Six-Day War the population of <this city> increased by 196%. The Jewish population grew by 155%, while the Arab population grew by 314%. The proportion of the Jewish population fell from 74% in 1967 to 72% in 1980, to 68% in 2000, and to 64% in 2010. <this country>i Agriculture Minister Ariel Sharon proposed building a ring of Jewish neighbourhoods around the city's eastern edges. The plan was intended to make East <this city> more Jewish and prevent it from becoming part of an urban Palestinian bloc stretching from Bethlehem to Ramallah. On 2 October 1977, the <this country>i cabinet approved the plan, and seven neighbourhoods were subsequently built on the city's eastern edges. They became known as the Ring Neighbourhoods. Other Jewish neighbourhoods were built within East <this city>, and <this country>i Jews also settled in Arab neighbourhoods.The annexation of East <this city> was met with international criticism. The <this country>i Foreign Ministry disputes that the annexation of <this city> was a violation of international law. The final status of <this city> has been one of the most important areas of discord between Palestinian and <this country>i negotiators for peace. Areas of discord have included whether the Palestinian flag can be raised over areas of Palestinian custodianship and the specificity of <this country>i and Palestinian territorial borders.\n\nPolitical status\nFrom 1923 until 1948, <this city> served as the administrative capital of Mandatory Palestine.From 1949 until 1967, West <this city> served as <this country>'s capital, but was not recognized as such internationally because UN General Assembly Resolution 194 envisaged <this city> as an international city. As a result of the Six-Day War in 1967, the whole of <this city> came under <this country>i control. On 27 June 1967, the government of Levi Eshkol extended <this country>i law and jurisdiction to East <this city>, but agreed that administration of the Temple Mount compound would be maintained by the Jordanian waqf, under the Jordanian Ministry of Religious Endowments.In 1988, <this country> ordered the closure of Orient House, home of the Arab Studies Society, but also the headquarters of the Palestine Liberation Organization, for security reasons. The building reopened in 1992 as a Palestinian guesthouse. The Oslo Accords stated that the final status of <this city> would be determined by negotiations with the Palestinian Authority. The accords banned any official Palestinian presence in the city until a final peace agreement, but provided for the opening of a Palestinian trade office in East <this city>. The Palestinian Authority regards East <this city> as the capital of a future Palestinian state. President Mahmoud Abbas has said that any agreement that did not include East <this city> as the capital of Palestine would be unacceptable. <this country>i Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has similarly stated that <this city> would remain the undivided capital of <this country>. Due to its proximity to the city, especially the Temple Mount, Abu Dis, a Palestinian suburb of <this city>, has been proposed as the future capital of a Palestinian state by <this country>. <this country> has not incorporated Abu Dis within its security wall around <this city>. The Palestinian Authority has built a possible future parliament building for the Palestinian Legislative Council in the town, and its <this city> Affairs Offices are all located in Abu Dis.\n\nInternational status\nWhile the international community regards East <this city>, including the entire Old City, as part of the occupied Palestinian territories, neither part, West or East <this city>, is recognized as part of the territory of <this country> or the State of Palestine. Under the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1947, <this city> was envisaged to become a corpus separatum administered by the United Nations. In the war of 1948, the western part of the city was occupied by forces of the nascent state of <this country>, while the eastern part was occupied by Jordan. The international community largely considers the legal status of <this city> to derive from the partition plan, and correspondingly refuses to recognize <this country>i sovereignty over the city.\n\nStatus under <this country>i rule\nFollowing the 1967 Six-Day War, <this country> extended its jurisdiction and administration over East <this city>, establishing new municipal borders.\n\nIn 2010, <this country> approved legislation giving <this city> the highest national priority status in <this country>. The law prioritized construction throughout the city, and offered grants and tax benefits to residents to make housing, infrastructure, education, employment, business, tourism, and cultural events more affordable. Communications Minister Moshe Kahlon said that the bill sent \"a clear, unequivocal political message that <this city> will not be divided\", and that \"all those within the Palestinian and international community who expect the current <this country>i government to accept any demands regarding <this country>'s sovereignty over its capital are mistaken and misleading\".\nThe status of the city, and especially its holy places, remains a core issue in the <this country>i\u2013Palestinian conflict. The <this country>i government has approved building plans in the Muslim Quarter of the Old City in order to expand the Jewish presence in East <this city>, while some Islamic leaders have made claims that Jews have no historical connection to <this city>, alleging that the 2,500-year-old Western Wall was constructed as part of a mosque. Palestinians regard <this city> as the capital of the State of Palestine, and the city's borders have been the subject of bilateral talks. A team of experts assembled by the then <this country>i Prime Minister Ehud Barak in 2000 concluded that the city must be divided, since <this country> had failed to achieve any of its national aims there. However, <this country>i Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in 2014 that \"<this city> will never be divided\". A poll conducted in June 2013 found that 74% of <this country>i Jews reject the idea of a Palestinian capital in any portion of <this city>, though 72% of the public regarded it as a divided city. A poll conducted by Palestinian Centre for Public Opinion and American Pechter Middle East Polls for the Council on Foreign Relations, among East <this city> Arab residents in 2011 revealed that 39% of East <this city> Arab residents would prefer <this country>i citizenship contrary to 31% who opted for Palestinian citizenship. According to the poll, 40% of Palestinian residents would prefer to leave their neighbourhoods if they would be placed under Palestinian rule.\n\n<this city> as capital of <this country>\nOn 5 December 1949, <this country>'s first Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion, proclaimed <this city> as <this country>'s \"eternal\" and \"sacred\" capital, and eight days later specified that only the war had \"compelled\" the <this country>i leadership \"to establish the seat of Government in Tel Aviv\", while \"for the State of <this country> there has always been and always will be one capital only \u2013 <this city> the Eternal\", and that after the war, efforts had been ongoing for creating the conditions for \"the Knesset... returning to <this city>.\" This indeed took place, and since the beginning of 1950 all branches of the <this country>i government\u2014legislative, judicial, and executive\u2014have resided there, except for the Ministry of Defense, which is located at HaKirya in Tel Aviv. At the time of Ben Gurion's proclamations and the ensuing Knesset vote of 24 January 1950, <this city> was divided between <this country> and Jordan, and thus the proclamation only applied to West <this city>.\nIn July 1980, <this country> passed the <this city> Law as Basic Law. The law declared <this city> the \"complete and united\" capital of <this country>. The <this city> Law was condemned by the international community, which did not recognize <this city> as the capital of <this country>. The United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 478 on 20 August 1980, which declared that the <this city> Law is \"a violation of international law\", is \"null and void and must be rescinded forthwith\". Member states were called upon to withdraw their diplomatic representation from <this city>. Following the resolution, 22 of the 24 countries that previously had their embassy in (West) <this city> relocated them in Tel Aviv, where many embassies already resided prior to Resolution 478. Costa Rica and El Salvador followed in 2006. There are two embassies\u2014United States and Guatemala\u2014and two consulates located within the city limits of <this city>, and two Latin American states maintain embassies in the <this city> District town of Mevaseret Zion (Bolivia and Paraguay). There are a number of consulates-general located in <this city>, which work primarily either with <this country>, or the Palestinian authorities.\nIn 1995, the United States Congress passed the <this city> Embassy Act, which required, subject to conditions, that its embassy be moved from Tel Aviv to <this city>. On 6 December 2017 U.S. President Donald Trump officially recognized <this city> as <this country>'s capital and announced his intention to move the American embassy to <this city>, reversing decades of United States policy on the issue. The move was criticized by many nations. A resolution condemning the US decision was supported by all the 14 other members of the UN Security Council, but was vetoed by the US on 18 December 2017, and a subsequent resolution condemning the US decision was passed in the United Nations General Assembly. On 14 May 2018, the United States officially opened its embassy in <this city>, transforming its Tel Aviv location into a consulate. Due to the general lack of international recognition of <this city> as <this country>'s capital, some non-<this country>i media outlets use Tel Aviv as a metonym for <this country>.In April 2017, the Russian Foreign Ministry announced it viewed Western <this city> as <this country>'s capital in the context of UN-approved principles which include the status of East <this city> as the capital of the future Palestinian state. On 15 December 2018, Australia officially recognized West <this city> as <this country>'s capital, but said their embassy in Tel Aviv would stay until a two-state resolution was settled. The decision was reversed in October 2022.\n\nGovernment precinct and national institutions\nThe Kiryat HaLeom (national precinct) project is intended to house most government agencies and national cultural institutions. They are located in the Kiryat HaMemshala (government complex) in the Givat Ram neighbourhood. Some government buildings are located in Kiryat Menachem Begin. The city is home to the Knesset, the Supreme Court, the Bank of <this country>, the National Headquarters of the <this country> Police, the official residences of the President and Prime Minister, the Cabinet, and all ministries except for the Ministry of Defense (which is located in central Tel Aviv's HaKirya district) and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (which is located in Rishon LeZion, in the wider Tel Aviv metropolitan area, near Beit Dagan).\n\n<this country>i settlements\nSince its capture in 1967, the <this country>i government has built 12 <this country>i settlements in East <this city>, with a population amounting to 220,000 <this country>i Jewish settlers as of 2019. The international community consider <this country>i settlements to be illegal under international law.\n\n<this city> as capital of Palestine\nThe Palestinian National Authority views East <this city> as occupied territory according to United Nations Security Council Resolution 242. The Palestinian Authority claims <this city>, including the Haram al-Sharif, as the capital of the State of Palestine, The PLO claims that West <this city> is also subject to permanent status negotiations. However, it has stated that it would be willing to consider alternative solutions, such as making <this city> an open city.The PLO's position is that East <this city>, as defined by the pre-1967 municipal boundaries, shall be the capital of Palestine and West <this city> the capital of <this country>, with each state enjoying full sovereignty over its respective part of the city and with its own municipality. A joint development council would be responsible for coordinated development.Some states, such as Russia and China, recognize the Palestinian state with East <this city> as its capital. United Nations General Assembly Resolution 58/292 affirmed that the Palestinian people have the right to sovereignty over East <this city>.\n\nMunicipal administration\nThe <this city> City Council is a body of 31 elected members headed by the mayor, who serves a five-year term and appoints eight deputies. The former mayor of <this city>, Uri Lupolianski, was elected in 2003. In the November 2008 city elections, Nir Barkat was elected. In November 2018, Moshe Lion was elected mayor.Apart from the mayor and his deputies, City Council members receive no salaries and work on a voluntary basis. The longest-serving <this city> mayor was Teddy Kollek, who spent 28 years\u2014six consecutive terms\u2014in office. Most of the meetings of the <this city> City Council are private, but each month, it holds a session that is open to the public. Within the city council, religious political parties form an especially powerful faction, accounting for the majority of its seats. The headquarters of the <this city> Municipality and the mayor's office are at Safra Square (Kikar Safra) on Jaffa Road. The municipal complex, comprising two modern buildings and ten renovated historic buildings surrounding a large plaza, opened in 1993 when it moved from the old town hall building built by the Mandate authorities. The city falls under the <this city> District, with <this city> as the district's capital. 37% of the population is Palestinian, but in 2014 not more than 10% of tax revenues were allocated for them. In East <this city>, 52% of the land was excluded from development, 35% designated for Jewish settlements, and 13% for Palestinian use, almost all of which was already built on.\n\nGeography\n<this city> is situated on the southern spur of a plateau in the Judaean Mountains, which include the Mount of Olives (East) and Mount Scopus (North East). The elevation of the Old City is approximately 760 m (2,490 ft). The whole of <this city> is surrounded by valleys and dry riverbeds (wadis). The Kidron, Hinnom, and Tyropoeon Valleys intersect in an area just south of the Old City of <this city>. The Kidron Valley runs to the east of the Old City and separates the Mount of Olives from the city proper. Along the southern side of old <this city> is the Valley of Hinnom, a steep ravine associated in biblical eschatology with the concept of Gehenna or Hell. The Tyropoeon Valley commenced in the northwest near the Damascus Gate, ran south-southeasterly through the centre of the Old City down to the Pool of Siloam, and divided the lower part into two hills, the Temple Mount to the east, and the rest of the city to the west (the lower and the upper cities described by Josephus). Today, this valley is hidden by debris that has accumulated over the centuries. In biblical times, <this city> was surrounded by forests of almond, olive and pine trees. Over centuries of warfare and neglect, these forests were destroyed. Farmers in the <this city> region thus built stone terraces along the slopes to hold back the soil, a feature still very much in evidence in the <this city> landscape.Water supply has always been a major problem in <this city>, as attested to by the intricate network of ancient aqueducts, tunnels, pools and cisterns found in the city.<this city> is 60 km (37 mi) east of Tel Aviv and the Mediterranean Sea. On the opposite side of the city, approximately 35 km (22 mi) away, is the Dead Sea, the lowest body of water on Earth. Neighbouring cities and towns include Bethlehem and Beit Jala to the south, Abu Dis and Ma'ale Adumim to the east, Mevaseret Zion to the west, and Ramallah and Giv'at Ze'ev to the north.Mount Herzl, at the western side of the city near the <this city> Forest, serves as the national cemetery of <this country>.\n\nClimate\nThe city is characterized by a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: Csa), with hot, dry summers, and mild, wet winters. Snow flurries usually occur once or twice a winter, although the city experiences heavy snowfall every three to four years, on average, with short-lived accumulation.\nJanuary is the coldest month of the year, with an average temperature of 9.1 \u00b0C (48.4 \u00b0F); July and August are the hottest months, with an average temperature of 24.2 \u00b0C (75.6 \u00b0F), and the summer months are usually rainless. The average annual precipitation is around 537 mm (21 in), with rain occurring almost entirely between October and May. Snowfall is rare, and large snowfalls are even more rare. <this city> received over 30 cm (12 in) of snow on 13 December 2013, which nearly paralyzed the city. A day in <this city> has on average, 9.3 sunshine hours. With summers averaging similar temperatures as the coastline, the maritime influence from the Mediterranean Sea is strong, in particular given that <this city> is located on a similar latitude as scorching hot deserts not far to its east.\nThe highest recorded temperature in <this city> was 44.4 \u00b0C (111.9 \u00b0F) on 28 and 30 August 1881, and the lowest temperature recorded was \u22126.7 \u00b0C (19.9 \u00b0F) on 25 January 1907.\nMost of the air pollution in <this city> comes from vehicular traffic. Many main streets in <this city> were not built to accommodate such a large volume of traffic, leading to traffic congestion and more carbon monoxide released into the air. Industrial pollution inside the city is sparse, but emissions from factories on the <this country>i Mediterranean coast can travel eastward and settle over the city.\n\nDemographics\nDemographic history\n<this city>'s population size and composition has shifted many times over its 5,000-year history. Since the 19th century, the Old City of <this city> has been divided into Jewish, Muslim, Christian, and Armenian quarters. Matthew Teller writes that this convention may have originated in the 1841 British Royal Engineers map of <this city>, or at least Reverend George Williams' subsequent labelling of it.Most population data before 1905 is based on estimates, often from foreign travellers or organisations, since previous census data usually covered wider areas such as the <this city> District. These estimates suggest that since the end of the Crusades, Muslims formed the largest group in <this city> until the mid-nineteenth century.\nBetween 1838 and 1876, a number of estimates exist which conflict as to whether Jews or Muslims were the largest group during this period, and between 1882 and 1922 estimates conflict as to exactly when Jews became an absolute majority of the population.\n\nCurrent demographics\nIn December 2007, <this city> had a population of 747,600\u201463.7% were Jewish, 33.1% Muslim, and 2% Christian.According to a study published in 2000, the percentage of Jews in the city's population had been decreasing; this was attributed to a higher Muslim birth rate, and Jewish residents leaving. The study also found that about nine percent of the Old City's 32,488 people were Jews. Of the Jewish population, 200,000 live in East <this city> settlements which are considered illegal under international law.In 2005, 2,850 new immigrants settled in <this city>, mostly from the United States, France and the former Soviet Union. In terms of the local population, the number of outgoing residents exceeds the number of incoming residents. In 2005, 16,000 left <this city> and only 10,000 moved in. Nevertheless, the population of <this city> continues to rise due to the high birth rate, especially in the Haredi Jewish and Arab communities. Consequently, the total fertility rate in <this city> (4.02) is higher than in Tel Aviv (1.98) and well above the national average of 2.90. The average size of <this city>'s 180,000 households is 3.8 people.In 2005, the total population grew by 13,000 (1.8%)\u2014similar to the <this country>i national average, but the religious and ethnic composition is shifting. While 31% of the Jewish population is made up of children below the age fifteen, the figure for the Arab population is 42%.In 1967, Jews accounted for 74 percent of the population, while the figure for 2006 is down nine percent. Possible factors are the high cost of housing, fewer job opportunities and the increasingly religious character of the city, although proportionally, young Haredim are leaving in higher numbers. The percentage of secular Jews, or those who 'wear their faith lightly' is dropping, with some 20,000 leaving the city over the past seven years (2012). They now number 31% of the population, the same percentage as the rising Haredi population.\nIn 2010, 61% of all Jewish children in <this city> studied in Haredi (Ultra-Orthodox) schools. This correlates with the high number of children in Haredi families.While some secular Jews leave <this city> for its relative lack of development and religious and political tensions, <this city>-born Palestinians cannot leave <this city>, or they lose their right to live in the city. Palestinians with a \"<this city> resident status\" are entitled to the subsidized healthcare and social security benefits <this country> provides to its citizens, and have the right to vote in municipal elections, but not to be voted in municipal elections, or to vote in national elections. Arabs in <this city> can send their children to <this country>i-run schools, although not every neighbourhood has one, and universities. <this country>i doctors and highly regarded hospitals such as Hadassah Medical Centre are available to residents.Demographics and the Jewish-Arab population divide play a major role in the dispute over <this city>. In 1998, the <this city> Development Authority expanded city limits to the west to include more areas heavily populated with Jews.\nWithin the past few years, there has been a steady increase in the Jewish birthrate and a steady decrease in the Arab birthrate. In May 2012, it was reported that the Jewish birthrate had overtaken the Arab birthrate. The city's birthrate stands about 4.2 children per Jewish family and 3.9 children per Arab family. In addition, increasing numbers of Jewish immigrants chose to settle in <this city>. In the last few years, thousands of Palestinians have moved to previously fully Jewish neighbourhoods of East <this city>, built after the 1967 Six-Day War. In 2007, 1,300 Palestinians lived in the previously exclusively Jewish neighbourhood of Pisgat Ze'ev and constituted three percent of the population in Neve Ya'akov. In the French Hill neighbourhood, Palestinians today constitute one-sixth of the overall population.At the end of 2008, the population of East <this city> was 456,300, comprising 60% of <this city>'s residents. Of these, 195,500 (43%) were Jews, (comprising 40% of the Jewish population of <this city> as a whole), and 260,800 (57%) were Muslim (comprising 98% of the Muslim population of <this city>). In 2008, the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics reported the number of Palestinians living in East <this city> was 208,000 according to a recently completed census.<this city>'s Jewish population is overwhelmingly religious. Only 18% of Jewish residents are secular. In addition, Haredi Jews comprise 35% of the city's adult Jewish population. In a phenomenon seen rarely around the world, the percentage of Jewish women who work, 81%, exceeds the percentage of Jewish men who work, 70%.<this city> had a population of 804,400 in 2011, of which Jews comprised 499,400 (62.1%), Muslims 281,100 (34.9%), Christians 14,700 (1.8%), and 9,000 (1.1%) were not classified by religion.<this city> had a population of 882,700 in 2016, of which Jews comprised 536,600 (60.8%), Muslims 319,800 (36.2%), Christians 15,800 (1.8%), and 10,300 unclassified (1.2%).<this city> had a population of 951,100 in 2020, of which Jews comprised 570,100 (59.9%), Muslims 353.800 (37.2%), Christians 16.300 (1.7%), and 10,800 unclassified (1.1%).\nAccording to Peace Now, approvals for building in <this country>i settlements in East <this city> have expanded by 60% under Donald Trump's term as U.S. president. Since 1991, Palestinians, who make up the majority of the residents in East <this city>, have only received 30% of the building permits.\n\nUrban planning issues\nCritics of efforts to promote a Jewish majority in <this city> say that government planning policies are motivated by demographic considerations and seek to limit Arab construction while promoting Jewish construction. According to a World Bank report, the number of recorded building violations between 1996 and 2000 was four and half times higher in Jewish neighbourhoods but four times fewer demolition orders were issued in West <this city> than in East <this city>; Arabs in <this city> were less likely to receive construction permits than Jews, and \"the authorities are much more likely to take action against Palestinian violators\" than Jewish violators of the permit process. In recent years, private Jewish foundations have received permission from the government to develop projects on disputed lands, such as the City of David archaeological site in the 60% Arab neighbourhood of Silwan (adjacent to the Old City), and the Museum of Tolerance on Mamilla Cemetery (adjacent to Zion Square).\n\nReligious significance\n<this city> has been sacred to Judaism for roughly 3000 years, to Christianity for around 2000 years, and to Islam for approximately 1400 years. The 2000 Statistical Yearbook of <this city> lists 1204 synagogues, 158 churches, and 73 mosques within the city. Despite efforts to maintain peaceful religious coexistence, some sites, such as the Temple Mount, have been a continuous source of friction and controversy.\n\nJudaism\n<this city> has been the holiest city in Judaism and the ancestral and spiritual homeland of the Jewish people since King David proclaimed it his capital in the 10th century BCE. Without counting its other names, <this city> appears in the Hebrew Bible 669 times. The first section, the Torah (Pentateuch), only mentions Moriah, but in later parts of the Bible, the city is mentioned explicitly. The Temple Mount, which was the site of Solomon's Temple and the Second Temple, is the holiest site in Judaism and the place Jews turn towards during prayer. The Western Wall, a remnant of the wall surrounding the Second Temple, is the holiest place where Jews are permitted to pray. Synagogues around the world are traditionally built with the Holy Ark facing <this city>, and Arks within <this city> face the Holy of Holies. As prescribed in the Mishna and codified in the Shulchan Aruch, daily prayers are recited while facing towards <this city> and the Temple Mount. Many Jews have \"Mizrach\" plaques hung on a wall of their homes to indicate the direction of prayer.\n\nChristianity\n<this city> is generally considered the cradle of Christianity. Christianity reveres <this city> for its Old Testament history, and also for its significance in the life of Jesus. According to the New Testament, Jesus was brought to <this city> soon after his birth and later in his life cleansed the Second Temple. The Cenacle, believed to be the site of Jesus' Last Supper, is located on Mount Zion in the same building that houses the Tomb of King David. Another prominent Christian site in <this city> is Golgotha, the site of the crucifixion. The Gospel of John describes it as being located outside <this city>, but recent archaeological evidence suggests Golgotha is a short distance from the Old City walls, within the present-day confines of the city. The land occupied by the Church of the Holy Sepulchre is considered one of the top candidates for Golgotha and thus has been a Christian pilgrimage site for the past 2000 years. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre is generally considered the most important church in Christendom.\n\nIslam\n<this city> is the third-holiest city in Sunni Islam. Islamic tradition holds that for approximately a year, before it was permanently switched to the Kaaba in Mecca, the qibla (direction of prayer) for Muslims was <this city>. The city's lasting place in Islam, however, is primarily due to Muhammad's Night Journey (c.\u2009620 CE). Muslims believe that Muhammad was miraculously transported one night from the Great Mosque of Mecca to the Temple Mount in <this city>, whereupon he ascended to Heaven to meet previous prophets of Islam. The first verse in the Qur'an's Surat al-Isra notes the destination of Muhammad's journey as al-masjid al-aq\u1e63\u0101 (\"the farthest place of prayer\"). In the earliest days of Islam, this was understood as a reference to a site in the heavens, however, Post-Rashidun Islamic scholars understood it as relating to <this city>, and particularly to the site of the former Jewish Temple. The hadith, a collection of the sayings of Muhammad, mentions that the location of the Al-Aqsa Mosque is in <this city>. The Al-Aqsa Mosque, originally named after the wider compound it sits within, was built on the Temple Mount under the Umayyad Caliph Al-Walid several decades after Muhammad's death to commemorate the place from which Muslims believe he had ascended to Heaven.\n\nEconomy\nHistorically, <this city>'s economy was supported almost exclusively by religious pilgrims, as it was far from the major ports of Jaffa and Gaza. <this city>'s religious and cultural landmarks today remain the top draw for foreign visitors, with the majority of tourists visiting the Western Wall and the Old City. In 2010, <this city> was named the top leisure travel city in Africa and the Middle East by Travel + Leisure magazine.\nin 2013, 75% of the 3.5 million tourists to <this country> visited <this city>.\nSince the establishment of the State of <this country>, the national government has remained a major player in <this city>'s economy. The government, centred in <this city>, generates a large number of jobs, and offers subsidies and incentives for new business initiatives and start-ups. Although Tel Aviv remains <this country>'s financial centre, a growing number of high tech companies are moving to <this city>, providing 12,000 jobs in 2006. Northern <this city>'s Har Hotzvim industrial park and the <this city> Technology Park in south <this city> are home to large Research and Development centres of international tech companies, among them Intel, Cisco Systems, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, IBM, Mobileye, Johnson & Johnson, Medtronic and more. In April 2015, Time Magazine picked <this city> as one of the five emerging tech hubs in the world, proclaiming that \"The city has become a flourishing centre for biomed, cleantech, Internet/mobile startups, accelerators, investors and supporting service providers.\"\nHigher than average percentages are employed in education (17.9% vs. 12.7%); health and welfare (12.6% vs. 10.7%); community and social services (6.4% vs. 4.7%); hotels and restaurants (6.1% vs. 4.7%); and public administration (8.2% vs. 4.7%). During the British Mandate, a law was passed requiring all buildings to be constructed of <this city> stone in order to preserve the unique historic and aesthetic character of the city. Complementing this building code, which is still in force, is the discouragement of heavy industry in <this city>; only about 2.2% of <this city>'s land is zoned for \"industry and infrastructure\". By comparison, the percentage of land in Tel Aviv zoned for industry and infrastructure is twice as high, and in Haifa, seven times as high. Only 8.5% of the <this city> District work force is employed in the manufacturing sector, which is half the national average (15.8%).\nAlthough many statistics indicate economic growth in the city, since 1967, East <this city> has lagged behind the development of West <this city>. Nevertheless, the percentage of households with employed persons is higher for Arab households (76.1%) than for Jewish households (66.8%). The unemployment rate in <this city> (8.3%) is slightly better than the national average (9.0%), although the civilian labour force accounted for less than half of all persons fifteen years or older\u2014lower in comparison to that of Tel Aviv (58.0%) and Haifa (52.4%). Poverty remains a problem in the city as 37% of the families in <this city> lived in 2011 below the poverty line. According to a report by the Association for Civil Rights in <this country> (ACRI), 78% of Arabs in <this city> lived in poverty in 2012, up from 64% in 2006. While the ACRI attributes the increase to the lack of employment opportunities, infrastructure and a worsening educational system, Ir Amim blames the legal status of Palestinians in <this city>.\n\nHigh-rise construction\n<this city> has traditionally had a low-rise skyline. About 18 tall buildings were built at different times in the downtown area when there was no clear policy over the matter. One of them, Holyland Tower 1, <this city>'s tallest building, is a skyscraper by international standards, rising 32 stories. Holyland Tower 2, which has been approved for construction, will reach the same height.\nA new master plan for the city will see many high-rise buildings, including skyscrapers, built in certain, designated areas of downtown <this city>. Under the plan, towers will line Jaffa Road and King George Street. One of the proposed towers along King George Street, the Migdal Merkaz HaYekum, is planned as a 65-story building, which would make it one of the tallest buildings in <this country>. At the entrance to the city, near the <this city> Chords Bridge and the Central Bus Station, twelve towers rising between 24 and 33 stories will be built, as part of a complex that will also include an open square and an underground train station serving a new express line between <this city> and Tel Aviv, and will be connected by bridges and tunnels. Eleven of the skyscrapers will be either office or apartment buildings, and one will be a 2,000-room hotel. The complex is expected to attract many businesses from Tel Aviv, and become the city's main business hub. In addition, a complex for the city's courts and the prosecutor's office will be built, as well as new buildings for Central Zionist Archives and <this country> State Archives. The skyscrapers built throughout the city are expected to contain public space, shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues, and it has been speculated that this may lead to a revitalization of downtown <this city>. In August 2015, the city council approved construction of a 344-foot pyramid-shaped skyscraper designed by Daniel Libeskind and Yigal Levi, in place of a rejected previous design by Libeskind; it is set to break ground by 2019.\n\nTransportation\n<this city> is served by highly developed communication infrastructures, making it a leading logistics hub for <this country>.\nThe <this city> Central Bus Station, located on Jaffa Road, is the busiest bus station in <this country>. It is served by Egged Bus Cooperative, which is the second-largest bus company in the world, The Dan serves the Bnei Brak-<this city> route along with Egged, and Superbus serves the routes between <this city>, Modi'in Illit, and Modi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut. The companies operate from <this city> Central Bus Station. Arab neighbourhoods in East <this city> and routes between <this city> and locations in the West Bank are served by the East <this city> Central Bus Station, a transportation hub located near the Old City's Damascus Gate. The <this city> Light Rail initiated service in August 2011. According to plans, the first rail line will be capable of transporting an estimated 200,000 people daily, and has 23 stops. The route is from Pisgat Ze'ev in the north via the Old City and city centre to Mt. Herzl in the south.\n\nAnother work in progress is a new high-speed rail line from Tel Aviv to <this city>, which became partially operational in 2018 and is expected to be completed in 2019. Its terminus will be a new underground station (80 m or 262 ft deep) serving the International Convention Centre and the Central Bus Station, and is planned to be extended eventually to Malha station. <this country> Railways operates train services to Malha train station from Tel Aviv via Beit Shemesh.Begin Expressway is one of <this city>'s major north\u2013south thoroughfares; it runs on the western side of the city, merging in the north with Route 443, which continues toward Tel Aviv. Route 60 runs through the centre of the city near the Green Line between East and West <this city>. Construction is progressing on parts of a 35 km (22 mi) ring road around the city, fostering faster connection between the suburbs. The eastern half of the project was conceptualized decades ago, but reaction to the proposed highway is still mixed.\n\nAirport\n<this city> is served by Ben Gurion Airport, some 50 km (30 mi) northwest of the <this city>, on the route to Tel Aviv. The Tel Aviv\u2013<this city> railway runs non-stop from <this city>\u2013Yitzhak Navon railway station to the airport and began operation in 2018.In the past, <this city> was also served by the local Atarot Airport. Atarot ceased operation in 2000.\n\nEducation\nUniversities\n<this city> is home to several prestigious universities offering courses in Hebrew, Arabic and English.\n\nFounded in 1925, the Hebrew University of <this city> has been ranked among the top 100 schools in the world. The Board of Governors has included such prominent Jewish intellectuals as Albert Einstein and Sigmund Freud. The university has produced several Nobel laureates; recent winners associated with Hebrew University include Avram Hershko, David Gross, and Daniel Kahneman. One of the university's major assets is the Jewish National and University Library, which houses over five million books. The library opened in 1892, over three decades before the university was established, and is one of the world's largest repositories of books on Jewish subjects. Today it is both the central library of the university and the national library of <this country>. The Hebrew University operates three campuses in <this city>, on Mount Scopus, on Giv'at Ram and a medical campus at the Hadassah Ein Kerem hospital. The Academy of the Hebrew Language are located in the Hebrew university in Givat Ram and the <this country> Academy of Sciences and Humanities located near the Presidents House.The <this city> College of Technology, founded in 1969, combines training in engineering and other high-tech industries with a Jewish studies programme. It is one of many schools in <this city>, from elementary school and up, that combine secular and religious studies. Numerous religious educational institutions and Yeshivot, including some of the most prestigious yeshivas, among them the Brisk, Chevron, Midrash Shmuel and Mir, are based in the city, with the Mir Yeshiva claiming to be the largest. There were nearly 8,000 twelfth-grade students in Hebrew-language schools during the 2003\u20132004 school year. However, due to the large portion of students in Haredi Jewish frameworks, only fifty-five percent of twelfth graders took matriculation exams (Bagrut) and only thirty-seven percent were eligible to graduate. Unlike public schools, many Haredi schools do not prepare students to take standardized tests. To attract more university students to <this city>, the city has begun to offer a special package of financial incentives and housing subsidies to students who rent apartments in downtown <this city>.Al-Quds University was established in 1984 to serve as a flagship university for the Arab and Palestinian peoples. It describes itself as the \"only Arab university in <this city>\". Bard College of Annandale-on-Hudson, New York and Al-Quds University agreed to open a joint college in a building originally built to house the Palestinian Legislative Council and Yasser Arafat's office. The college gives Master of Arts in Teaching degrees. Al-Quds University resides southeast of the city proper on a 190,000 m2 (47-acre) Abu Dis campus.Other institutions of higher learning in <this city> are the <this city> Academy of Music and Dance and Bezalel Academy of Art and Design, whose buildings are located on the campuses of the Hebrew University.\n\nArab schools\n<this country>'s public schools for Arabs in <this city> and other parts of the country have been criticized for offering a lower quality education than those catering to <this country>i Jewish students. While many schools in the heavily Arab East <this city> are filled to capacity and there have been complaints of overcrowding, the <this city> Municipality is building over a dozen new schools in the city's Arab neighbourhoods. Schools in Ras el-Amud and Umm Lison opened in 2008. In March 2007, the <this country>i government approved a five-year plan to build 8,000 new classrooms in the city, 40 percent in the Arab sector and 28 percent in the Haredi sector. A budget of 4.6 billion shekels was allocated for this project. In 2008, Jewish British philanthropists donated $3 million for the construction of schools for Arabs in East <this city>. Arab high school students take the Bagrut matriculation exams, so that much of their curriculum parallels that of other <this country>i high schools and includes certain Jewish subjects.\n\nCulture\nAlthough <this city> is known primarily for its religious significance, the city is also home to many artistic and cultural venues. The <this country> Museum attracts nearly one million visitors a year, approximately one-third of them tourists. The 8 ha (20-acre) museum complex comprises several buildings featuring special exhibits and extensive collections of Judaica, archaeological findings, and <this country>i and European art. The Dead Sea scrolls, discovered in the mid-20th century in the Qumran Caves near the Dead Sea, are housed in the Museum's Shrine of the Book. The Youth Wing, which mounts changing exhibits and runs an extensive art education programme, is visited by 100,000 children a year. The museum has a large outdoor sculpture garden and includes the Holyland Model of <this city>, a scale-model of the city during the late Second Temple period. The Ticho House in downtown <this city> houses the paintings of Anna Ticho and the Judaica collections of her husband, an ophthalmologist who opened <this city>'s first eye clinic in this building in 1912.\nNext to the <this country> Museum is the Bible Lands Museum, near The National Campus for the Archaeology of <this country>, which includes the <this country> Antiquities Authority offices. A World Bible Centre is planned to be built adjacent to Mount Zion at a site called the \"Bible Hill\". A planned World Kabbalah Centre is to be located on the nearby promenade, overlooking the Old City. The Rockefeller Museum, located in East <this city>, was the first archaeological museum in the Middle East. It was built in 1938 during the British Mandate. In 2006, a 38 km (24 mi) <this city> Trail was opened, a hiking trail that goes to many cultural sites and national parks in and around <this city>. The <this city> Biblical Zoo has ranked consistently as <this country>'s top tourist attraction for <this country>is.The national cemetery of <this country> is located at the city's western edge, near the <this city> Forest on Mount Herzl. The western extension of Mount Herzl is the Mount of Remembrance, where the main Holocaust museum of <this country> is located. Yad Vashem, <this country>'s national memorial to the victims of the Holocaust, houses the world's largest library of Holocaust-related information. It houses an estimated 100,000 books and articles. The complex contains a state-of-the-art museum that explores the genocide of the Jews through exhibits that focus on the personal stories of individuals and families killed in the Holocaust. An art gallery featuring the work of artists who perished is also present. Further, Yad Vashem commemorates the 1.5 million Jewish children murdered by the Nazis, and honours the Righteous among the Nations.\nThe <this city> Symphony Orchestra, established in the 1940s, has appeared around the world. The International Convention Centre (Binyanei HaUma) near the entrance to city houses the <this country> Philharmonic Orchestra. The <this city> Cinemateque, the Gerard Behar Centre (formerly Beit Ha'Am) in downtown <this city>, the <this city> Music Centre in Yemin Moshe, and the Targ Music Centre in Ein Kerem also present the arts. The <this country> Festival, featuring indoor and outdoor performances by local and international singers, concerts, plays, and street theatre has been held annually since 1961, and <this city> has been the major organizer of this event. The <this city> Theatre in the Talbiya neighbourhood hosts over 150 concerts a year, as well as theatre and dance companies and performing artists from overseas. The Khan Theatre, located in a caravanserai opposite the old <this city> train station, is the city's only repertoire theatre. The station itself has become a venue for cultural events in recent years as the site of Shav'ua Hasefer (an annual week-long book fair) and outdoor music performances. The <this city> Film Festival is held annually, screening <this country>i and international films. In 1974 the <this city> Cinematheque was founded. In 1981 it was moved to a new building on Hebron Road near the Valley of Hinnom and the Old City.\n<this city> was declared the Capital of Arab Culture in 2009. <this city> is home to the Palestinian National Theatre, which engages in cultural preservation as well as innovation, working to rekindle Palestinian interest in the arts.

The Islamic Museum on the Temple Mount, established in 1923, houses many Islamic artifacts, from tiny kohl flasks and rare manuscripts to giant marble columns. Al-Hoash, established in 2004, is a gallery for the preservation of Palestinian art. While <this country> approves and financially supports some Arab cultural activities, Arab Capital of Culture events were banned because they were sponsored by the Palestine National Authority. In 2009, a four-day culture festival was held in the Beit 'Anan suburb of <this city>, attended by more than 15,000 peopleThe Museum on the Seam, which explores issues of coexistence through art, is situated on the road dividing eastern and western <this city>.

The Jewish-Arab Youth Orchestra performs both European classical and Middle Eastern music. In 2008, the Tolerance Monument, an outdoor sculpture by Czes\u0142aw D\u017awigaj, was erected on a hill between Jewish Armon HaNetziv and Arab Jebl Mukaber as a symbol of <this city>'s quest for peace.\n\nMedia\n<this city> is the state broadcasting centre of <this country>.
