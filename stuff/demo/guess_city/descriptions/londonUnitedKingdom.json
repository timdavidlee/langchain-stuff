  "wiki_text": "<this city> ( (listen)) is the capital and largest city of England and the <this country>, with a population of just under 9 million. It stands on the River Thames in south-east England at the head of a 50-mile (80 km) estuary down to the North Sea and has been a major settlement for two millennia. The City of <this city>, its ancient core and financial centre, was founded by the Romans as Londinium and retains its mediaeval boundaries. The City of Westminster, to the west of the City of <this city>, has for centuries hosted the national government and parliament. Since the 19th century, the name \"<this city>\" also refers to the metropolis around this core, historically split among the counties of Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which since 1965 has largely comprised Greater <this city>, which is governed by 33 local authorities and the Greater <this city> Authority.As one of the world's major global cities, <this city> exerts a strong influence on its arts, entertainment, fashion, commerce and finance, education, health care, media, science and technology, tourism, transport, and communications. Its GDP (\u20ac801.66 billion in 2017) makes it the largest urban economy in Europe, and it is one of the major financial centres in the world. With Europe's largest concentration of higher education institutions, it is home to some of the highest-ranked academic institutions in the world\u2014Imperial College <this city> in natural and applied sciences, the <this city> School of Economics in social sciences, and the comprehensive University College <this city>. <this city> is the most visited city in Europe and has the busiest city airport system in the world. The <this city> Underground is the oldest rapid transit system in the world.<this city>'s diverse cultures encompass over 300 languages. The mid-2018 population of Greater <this city> of about 9 million made it Europe's third-most populous city, accounting for 13.4% of the population of the <this country> and over 16% of the population of England. The Greater <this city> Built-up Area is the fourth-most populous in Europe, with about 9.8 million inhabitants at the 2011 census. The <this city> metropolitan area is the third-most populous in Europe, with about 14 million inhabitants in 2016, granting <this city> the status of a megacity.\n<this city> has four World Heritage Sites: the Tower of <this city>; Kew Gardens; the combined Palace of Westminster, Westminster Abbey, and St Margaret's Church; and also the historic settlement in Greenwich, where the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, defines the prime meridian (0\u00b0 longitude) and Greenwich Mean Time. Other landmarks include Buckingham Palace, the <this city> Eye, Piccadilly Circus, St Paul's Cathedral, Tower Bridge, and Trafalgar Square. <this city> has many museums, galleries, libraries, and cultural venues, including the British Museum, National Gallery, Natural History Museum, Tate Modern, British Library, and numerous West End theatres. Important sporting events held in <this city> include the FA Cup Final, the Wimbledon Tennis Championships, and the <this city> Marathon. In 2012, <this city> became the first city to host three Summer Olympic Games.\n\nToponymy\n<this city> is an ancient name, attested in the first century AD, usually in the Latinised form Londinium. Modern scientific analyses of the name must account for the origins of the different forms found in early sources: Latin (usually Londinium), Old English (usually Lunden), and Welsh (usually Llundein), with reference to the known developments over time of sounds in those different languages. It is agreed that the name came into these languages from Common Brythonic; recent work tends to reconstruct the lost Celtic form of the name as *<this city>jon or something similar. This was adapted into Latin as Londinium and borrowed into Old English.Until 1889, the name \"<this city>\" applied officially only to the City of <this city>, but since then it has also referred to the County of <this city> and to Greater <this city>.\n\nHistory\nPrehistory\nIn 1993, remains of a Bronze Age bridge were found on the south foreshore upstream from Vauxhall Bridge. Two of the timbers were radiocarbon dated to 1750\u20131285 BC. In 2010, foundations of a large timber structure, dated to 4800\u20134500 BC, were found on the Thames's south foreshore downstream from Vauxhall Bridge. Both structures are on the south bank of the Thames, where the now-underground River Effra flows into the Thames.\n\nRoman <this city>\nDespite the evidence of scattered Brythonic settlements in the area, the first major settlement was founded by the Romans around 47 AD, about four years after their invasion of 43 AD. This only lasted until about 61 AD, when the Iceni tribe led by Queen Boudica stormed it and burnt it to the ground.The next planned incarnation of Londinium prospered, superseding Colchester as the principal city of the Roman province of Britannia in 100. At its height in the 2nd century, Roman <this city> had a population of about 60,000.\n\nAnglo-Saxon and Viking-period <this city>\nWith the early 5th-century collapse of Roman rule, the walled city of Londinium was effectively abandoned, although Roman civilisation continued around St Martin-in-the-Fields until about 450. From about 500, an Anglo-Saxon settlement known as Lundenwic developed slightly west of the old Roman city. By about 680 the city had become a major port again, but there is little evidence of large-scale production. From the 820s repeated Viking assaults brought decline. Three are recorded; those in 851 and 886 succeeded, while the last, in 994, was rebuffed.The Vikings applied Danelaw over much of eastern and northern England, its boundary running roughly from <this city> to Chester as an area of political and geographical control imposed by the Viking incursions formally agreed by the Danish warlord, Guthrum and the West Saxon king Alfred the Great in 886. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that Alfred \"refounded\" <this city> in 886. Archaeological research shows this involved abandonment of Lundenwic and a revival of life and trade within the old Roman walls. <this city> then grew slowly until a dramatic increase in about 950.By the 11th century, <this city> was clearly the largest town in England. Westminster Abbey, rebuilt in Romanesque style by King Edward the Confessor, was one of the grandest churches in Europe. Winchester had been the capital of Anglo-Saxon England, but from this time <this city> became the main forum for foreign traders and the base for defence in time of war. In the view of Frank Stenton: \"It had the resources, and it was rapidly developing the dignity and the political self-consciousness appropriate to a national capital.\"\n\nMiddle Ages\nAfter winning the Battle of Hastings, William, Duke of Normandy was crowned King of England in newly completed Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day 1066. William built the Tower of <this city>, the first of many such in England rebuilt in stone in the south-eastern corner of the city, to intimidate the inhabitants. In 1097, William II began building Westminster Hall, close by the abbey of the same name. It became the basis of a new Palace of Westminster.In the 12th century, the institutions of central government, which had hitherto followed the royal English court around the country, grew in size and sophistication and became increasingly fixed, for most purposes at Westminster, although the royal treasury came to rest in the Tower. While the City of Westminster developed into a true governmental capital, its distinct neighbour, the City of <this city>, remained England's largest city and principal commercial centre and flourished under its own unique administration, the Corporation of <this city>. In 1100, its population was some 18,000; by 1300 it had grown to nearly 100,000. With the Black Death in the mid-14th century, <this city> lost nearly a third of its population. <this city> was the focus of the Peasants' Revolt in 1381.<this city> was a centre of England's Jewish population before their expulsion by Edward I in 1290. Violence against Jews occurred in 1190, when it was rumoured that the new king had ordered their massacre after they had presented themselves at his coronation. In 1264 during the Second Barons' War, Simon de Montfort's rebels killed 500 Jews while attempting to seize records of debts.\n\nEarly modern\nDuring the Tudor period, the Reformation produced a gradual shift to Protestantism. Much of <this city> property passed from church to private ownership, which accelerated trade and business in the city. In 1475, the Hanseatic League set up a main trading base (kontor) of England in <this city>, called the Stalhof or Steelyard. It remained until 1853, when the Hanseatic cities of L\u00fcbeck, Bremen and Hamburg sold the property to South Eastern Railway. Woollen cloth was shipped undyed and undressed from 14th/15th century <this city> to the nearby shores of the Low Countries.Yet English maritime enterprise hardly reached beyond the seas of north-west Europe. The commercial route to Italy and the Mediterranean was normally through Antwerp and over the Alps; any ships passing through the Strait of Gibraltar to or from England were likely to be Italian or Ragusan. The reopening of the Netherlands to English shipping in January 1565 spurred a burst of commercial activity. The Royal Exchange was founded. Mercantilism grew and monopoly traders such as the East India Company were founded as trade expanded to the New World. <this city> became the main North Sea port, with migrants arriving from England and abroad. The population rose from about 50,000 in 1530 to about 225,000 in 1605.In the 16th century, William Shakespeare and his contemporaries lived in <this city> during English Renaissance theatre. Shakespeare's Globe Theatre was constructed in 1599 in Southwark. Stage performances came to a halt in <this city> when Puritan authorities shut down the theatres in the 1640s and 1650s. The ban on theatre was lifted during the Restoration in 1660, and <this city>'s oldest operating theatre, Drury Lane, opened in 1663 in what is now the West End theatre district.By the end of the Tudor period in 1603, <this city> was still compact. There was an assassination attempt on James I in Westminster, in the Gunpowder Plot of 5 November 1605. In 1637, the government of Charles I attempted to reform administration in the <this city> area. This called for the Corporation of the city to extend its jurisdiction and administration over expanding areas around the city. Fearing an attempt by the Crown to diminish the Liberties of <this city>, coupled with a lack of interest in administering these additional areas or concern by city guilds of having to share power, caused the Corporation's \"The Great Refusal\", a decision which largely continues to account for the unique governmental status of the City.In the English Civil War, the majority of <this city>ers supported the Parliamentary cause. After an initial advance by the Royalists in 1642, culminating in the battles of Brentford and Turnham Green, <this city> was surrounded by a defensive perimeter wall known as the Lines of Communication. The lines were built by up to 20,000 people, and were completed in under two months.\nThe fortifications failed their only test when the New Model Army entered <this city> in 1647, and they were levelled by Parliament the same year.\n<this city> was plagued by disease in the early 17th century, culminating in the Great Plague of 1665\u20131666, which killed up to 100,000 people, or a fifth of the population.The Great Fire of <this city> broke out in 1666 in Pudding Lane in the city and quickly swept through the wooden buildings. Rebuilding took over ten years and was supervised by polymath Robert Hooke. In 1708 Christopher Wren's masterpiece, St Paul's Cathedral, was completed. During the Georgian era, new districts such as Mayfair were formed in the west; new bridges over the Thames encouraged development in South <this city>. In the east, the Port of <this city> expanded downstream. <this city>'s development as an international financial centre matured for much of the 18th century.In 1762, George III acquired Buckingham House, which was enlarged over the next 75 years. During the 18th century, <this city> was said to be dogged by crime, and the Bow Street Runners were established in 1750 as a professional police force. Epidemics during the 1720s and 30s saw most children born in the city die before reaching their fifth birthday.Coffee-houses became a popular place to debate ideas, as growing literacy and development of the printing press made news widely available, with Fleet Street becoming the centre of the British press. The invasion of Amsterdam by Napoleonic armies led many financiers to relocate to <this city> and the first <this city> international issue was arranged in 1817. Around the same time, the Royal Navy became the world's leading war fleet, acting as a major deterrent to potential economic adversaries. The repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846 was specifically aimed at weakening Dutch economic power. <this city> then overtook Amsterdam as the leading international financial centre.\n\nLate modern and contemporary\nWith the onset of the Industrial Revolution in Britain, an unprecedented growth in urbanisation took place, and the number of High Streets (the primary street for retail in Britain) rapidly grew. <this city> was the world's largest city from about 1831 to 1925, with a population density of 802 per acre (325 per hectare). In addition to the growing number of stores selling goods, such as Harding, Howell & Co.\u2014one of the first department stores\u2014located on Pall Mall, the streets had scores of street sellers. <this city>'s overcrowded conditions led to cholera epidemics, claiming 14,000 lives in 1848, and 6,000 in 1866. Rising traffic congestion led to the creation of the world's first local urban rail network. The Metropolitan Board of Works oversaw infrastructure expansion in the capital and some surrounding counties; it was abolished in 1889 when the <this city> County Council was created out of county areas surrounding the capital.From the early years of the 20th century onwards, teashops were found on High Streets across <this city> and the rest of Britain, with Lyons, who opened the first of their chain of teashops in Piccadilly in 1894, leading the way. The tearooms, such as the Criterion in Piccadilly, became a popular meeting place for women from the suffrage movement. The city was the target of many attacks during the suffragette bombing and arson campaign, between 1912 and 1914, which saw historic landmarks such as Westminster Abbey and St Paul's Cathedral bombed.\n\n<this city> was bombed by the Germans in the First World War, and during the Second World War, the Blitz and other bombings by the German Luftwaffe killed over 30,000 <this city>ers, destroying large tracts of housing and other buildings across the city. The tomb of the Unknown Warrior, an unidentified member of the British armed forces killed during the First World War, was buried in Westminster Abbey on 11 November 1920. The Cenotaph, located in Whitehall, was unveiled on the same day, and is the focal point for the National Service of Remembrance held annually on Remembrance Sunday, the closest Sunday to 11 November.The 1948 Summer Olympics were held at the original Wembley Stadium, while <this city> was still recovering from the war. From the 1940s, <this city> became home to many immigrants, primarily from Commonwealth countries such as Jamaica, India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, making <this city> one of the most diverse cities in the world. In 1951, the Festival of Britain was held on the South Bank. The Great Smog of 1952 led to the Clean Air Act 1956, which ended the \"pea soup fogs\" for which <this city> had been notorious, and had earned it the nickname the \"Big Smoke\".Starting mainly in the mid-1960s, <this city> became a centre for worldwide youth culture, exemplified by the Swinging <this city> sub-culture associated with the King's Road, Chelsea and Carnaby Street. The role of trendsetter revived in the punk era. In 1965 <this city>'s political boundaries were expanded in response to the growth of the urban area and a new Greater <this city> Council was created. During The Troubles in Northern Ireland, <this city> was hit from 1973 by bomb attacks by the Provisional Irish Republican Army. These attacks lasted for two decades, starting with the Old Bailey bombing. Racial inequality was highlighted by the 1981 Brixton riot.Greater <this city>'s population declined in the decades after the Second World War, from an estimated peak of 8.6 million in 1939 to around 6.8 million in the 1980s. The principal ports for <this city> moved downstream to Felixstowe and Tilbury, with the <this city> Docklands area becoming a focus for regeneration, including the Canary Wharf development. This was born out of <this city>'s increasing role as an international financial centre in the 1980s. Located about 2 miles (3.2 km) east of central <this city>, the Thames Barrier was completed in the 1980s to protect <this city> against tidal surges from the North Sea.The Greater <this city> Council was abolished in 1986, leaving <this city> with no central administration until 2000 and the creation of the Greater <this city> Authority. To mark the 21st century, the Millennium Dome, <this city> Eye and Millennium Bridge were constructed. On 6 July 2005 <this city> was awarded the 2012 Summer Olympics, as the first city to stage the Olympic Games three times. On 7 July 2005, three <this city> Underground trains and a double-decker bus were bombed in a series of terrorist attacks.In 2008, Time named <this city> alongside New York City and Hong Kong as Nylonkong, hailing them as the world's three most influential global cities. In January 2015, Greater <this city>'s population was estimated to be 8.63 million, its highest since 1939. During the Brexit referendum in 2016, the UK as a whole decided to leave the European Union, but most <this city> constituencies voted for remaining.\n\nAdministration\nLocal government\nThe administration of <this city> is formed of two tiers: a citywide, strategic tier and a local tier. Citywide administration is coordinated by the Greater <this city> Authority (GLA), while local administration is carried out by 33 smaller authorities. The GLA consists of two elected components: the mayor of <this city>, who has executive powers, and the <this city> Assembly, which scrutinises the mayor's decisions and can accept or reject the mayor's budget proposals each year. The GLA has responsibility for the majority of <this city>'s transport system through its functional arm Transport for <this city> (TfL), it is responsible for overseeing the city's police and fire services, and also for setting a strategic vision for <this city> on a range of issues. The headquarters of the GLA is City Hall, Newham. The mayor since 2016 has been Sadiq Khan, the first Muslim mayor of a major Western capital. The mayor's statutory planning strategy is published as the <this city> Plan, which was most recently revised in 2011.The local authorities are the councils of the 32 <this city> boroughs and the City of <this city> Corporation. They are responsible for most local services, such as local planning, schools, libraries, leisure and recreation, social services, local roads and refuse collection. Certain functions, such as waste management, are provided through joint arrangements. In 2009\u20132010 the combined revenue expenditure by <this city> councils and the GLA amounted to just over \u00a322 billion (\u00a314.7 billion for the boroughs and \u00a37.4 billion for the GLA).The <this city> Fire Brigade is the statutory fire and rescue service for Greater <this city>, run by the <this city> Fire and Emergency Planning Authority. It is the third largest fire service in the world. National Health Service ambulance services are provided by the <this city> Ambulance Service (LAS) NHS Trust, the largest free-at-the-point-of-use emergency ambulance service in the world. The <this city> Air Ambulance charity operates in conjunction with the LAS where required. Her Majesty's Coastguard and the Royal National Lifeboat Institution operate on the River Thames, which is under the jurisdiction of the Port of <this city> Authority from Teddington Lock to the sea.\n\nNational government\n<this city> is the seat of the Government of the <this country>. Many government departments, as well as the prime minister's residence at 10 Downing Street, are based close to the Palace of Westminster, particularly along Whitehall. There are 73 members of Parliament (MPs) from <this city>; As of December 2019, 49 are from the Labour Party, 21 are Conservatives, and three are Liberal Democrats. The ministerial post of minister for <this city> was created in 1994 and as of 2020 is held by Paul Scully.\n\nPolicing and crime\nPolicing in Greater <this city>, with the exception of the City of <this city>, is provided by the Metropolitan Police (\"The Met\"), overseen by the mayor through the Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime (MOPAC). The Met is also referred to as Scotland Yard after the location of its original headquarters in a road called Great Scotland Yard in Whitehall. The City of <this city> has its own police force \u2013 the City of <this city> Police. First worn by Met police officers in 1863, the custodian helmet has been called a \"cultural icon\" and a \"symbol of British law enforcement\". Introduced by the Met in 1929, the blue police telephone box (basis for the TARDIS in Doctor Who) was once a common sight throughout <this city> and regional cities in the UK.\nThe British Transport Police are responsible for police services on National Rail, <this city> Underground, Docklands Light Railway and Tramlink services.\nThe Ministry of Defence Police is a special police force in <this city>, which does not generally become involved with policing the general public. The UK's domestic counter-intelligence service (MI5) is headquartered in Thames House on the north bank of the River Thames, and the foreign intelligence service (MI6) is headquartered in the SIS Building on the south bank.Crime rates vary widely across different areas of <this city>. Crime figures are made available nationally at Local Authority and Ward level. In 2015, there were 118 homicides, a 25.5% increase over 2014.\nRecorded crime has been rising in <this city>, notably violent crime and murder by stabbing and other means have risen. There were 50 murders from the start of 2018 to mid April 2018. Funding cuts to police in <this city> are likely to have contributed to this, though other factors are involved. However, the murder rate in <this city> is much lower than other major cities around the world.\n\nGeography\nScope\n<this city>, also known as Greater <this city>, is one of nine regions of England and the top subdivision covering most of the city's metropolis. The City of <this city> at its core once comprised the whole settlement, but as its urban area grew, the Corporation of <this city> resisted attempts to amalgamate the City with its suburbs, causing \"<this city>\" to be defined several ways.Forty per cent of Greater <this city> is covered by the <this city> post town, in which 'LONDON' forms part of postal addresses. The <this city> telephone area code (020) covers a larger area, similar in size to Greater <this city>, although some outer districts are excluded and some just outside included. The Greater <this city> boundary has been aligned to the M25 motorway in places.Further urban expansion is now prevented by the Metropolitan Green Belt, although the built-up area extends beyond the boundary in places, producing a separately defined Greater <this city> Urban Area. Beyond this is the vast <this city> commuter belt. Greater <this city> is split for some purposes into Inner <this city> and Outer <this city>, and by the River Thames into North and South, with an informal central <this city> area. The coordinates of the nominal centre of <this city>, traditionally the original Eleanor Cross at Charing Cross near the junction of Trafalgar Square and Whitehall, are about 51\u00b030\u203226\u2033N 00\u00b007\u203239\u2033W.\n\nStatus\nWithin <this city>, both the City of <this city> and the City of Westminster have city status and both the City of <this city> and the remainder of Greater <this city> are counties for the purposes of lieutenancies. The area of Greater <this city> includes areas that are part of the historic counties of Middlesex, Kent, Surrey, Essex and Hertfordshire. <this city>'s status as the capital of England, and later the <this country>, has never been granted or confirmed by statute or in written form.Its status as a capital was established by constitutional convention, which means its status as de facto capital is a part of the UK's uncodified constitution. The capital of England was moved to <this city> from Winchester as the Palace of Westminster developed in the 12th and 13th centuries to become the permanent location of the royal court, and thus the political capital of the nation. More recently, Greater <this city> has been defined as a region of England and in this context is known as <this city>.\n\nTopography\nGreater <this city> encompasses a total area of 611 square miles (1,583 km2) an area which had a population of 7,172,036 in 2001 and a population density of 11,760 inhabitants per square mile (4,542/km2). The extended area known as the <this city> Metropolitan Region or the <this city> Metropolitan Agglomeration, comprises a total area of 3,236 square miles (8,382 km2) has a population of 13,709,000 and a population density of 3,900 inhabitants per square mile (1,510/km2).Modern <this city> stands on the Thames, its primary geographical feature, a navigable river which crosses the city from the south-west to the east. The Thames Valley is a flood plain surrounded by gently rolling hills including Parliament Hill, Addington Hills, and Primrose Hill. Historically <this city> grew up at the lowest bridging point on the Thames. The Thames was once a much broader, shallower river with extensive marshlands; at high tide, its shores reached five times their present width.Since the Victorian era the Thames has been extensively embanked, and many of its <this city> tributaries now flow underground. The Thames is a tidal river, and <this city> is vulnerable to flooding. The threat has increased over time because of a slow but continuous rise in high water level caused by climate change and by the slow 'tilting' of the British Isles as a result of post-glacial rebound.\n\nClimate\n<this city> has a temperate oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb). Rainfall records have been kept in the city since at least 1697, when records began at Kew. At Kew, the most rainfall in one month is 7.4 inches (189 mm) in November 1755 and the least is 0 inches (0 mm) in both December 1788 and July 1800. Mile End also had 0 inches (0 mm) in April 1893. The wettest year on record is 1903, with a total fall of 38.1 inches (969 mm) and the driest is 1921, with a total fall of 12.1 inches (308 mm). The average annual precipitation amounts to about 600 mm, which is half the annual rainfall of New York City. Despite its relatively low annual precipitation, <this city> still receives 109.6 rainy days on the 1.0 mm threshold annually. However, <this city> is vulnerable to climate change in the <this country>, and there is increasing concern among hydrological experts that <this city> households may run out of water before 2050.Temperature extremes in <this city> range from 40.2 \u00b0C (104.4 \u00b0F) at Heathrow on 19 July 2022 down to \u221217.4 \u00b0C (0.7 \u00b0F) at Northolt on 13 December 1981. Records for atmospheric pressure have been kept at <this city> since 1692. The highest pressure ever reported is 1,049.8 millibars (31.00 inHg) on 20 January 2020.Summers are generally warm, sometimes hot. <this city>'s average July high is 23.5 \u00b0C (74.3 \u00b0F). On average each year, <this city> experiences 31 days above 25 \u00b0C (77.0 \u00b0F) and 4.2 days above 30.0 \u00b0C (86.0 \u00b0F). During the 2003 European heat wave, prolonged heat led to hundreds of heat-related deaths. A previous spell of 15 consecutive days above 32.2 \u00b0C (90.0 \u00b0F) in England in 1976 also caused many heat related deaths. A previous temperature of 37.8 \u00b0C (100.0 \u00b0F) in August 1911 at the Greenwich station was later disregarded as non-standard. Droughts can also, occasionally, be a problem, especially in summer, most recently in summer 2018, and with much drier than average conditions prevailing from May to December. However, the most consecutive days without rain was 73 days in the spring of 1893.Winters are generally cool with little temperature variation. Heavy snow is rare but snow usually falls at least once each winter. Spring and autumn can be pleasant. As a large city, <this city> has a considerable urban heat island effect, making the centre of <this city> at times 5 \u00b0C (9 \u00b0F) warmer than the suburbs and outskirts.\n\nAreas\nPlaces within <this city>'s vast urban area are identified using area names, such as Mayfair, Southwark, Wembley, and Whitechapel. These are either informal designations, reflect the names of villages that have been absorbed by sprawl, or are superseded administrative units such as parishes or former boroughs.\nSuch names have remained in use through tradition, each referring to a local area with its own distinctive character, but without official boundaries. Since 1965, Greater <this city> has been divided into 32 <this city> boroughs in addition to the ancient City of <this city>. The City of <this city> is the main financial district, and Canary Wharf has recently developed into a new financial and commercial hub in the Docklands to the east.\nThe West End is <this city>'s main entertainment and shopping district, attracting tourists. West <this city> includes expensive residential areas where properties can sell for tens of millions of pounds. The average price for properties in Kensington and Chelsea is over \u00a32 million with a similarly high outlay in most of central <this city>.The East End is the area closest to the original Port of <this city>, known for its high immigrant population, as well as for being one of the poorest areas in <this city>. The surrounding East <this city> area saw much of <this city>'s early industrial development; now, brownfield sites throughout the area are being redeveloped as part of the Thames Gateway including the <this city> Riverside and Lower Lea Valley, which was developed into the Olympic Park for the 2012 Olympics and Paralympics.\n\nArchitecture\n<this city>'s buildings are too diverse to be characterised by any particular architectural style, partly because of their varying ages. Many grand houses and public buildings, such as the National Gallery, are constructed from Portland stone. Some areas of the city, particularly those just west of the centre, are characterised by white stucco or whitewashed buildings. Few structures in central <this city> pre-date the Great Fire of 1666, these being a few trace Roman remains, the Tower of <this city> and a few scattered Tudor survivors in the city. Further out is, for example, the Tudor-period Hampton Court Palace.Part of the varied architectural heritage are the 17th-century churches by Christopher Wren, neoclassical financial institutions such as the Royal Exchange and the Bank of England, to the early 20th century Old Bailey courthouse and the 1960s Barbican Estate. The 1939 Battersea Power Station by the river in the south-west is a local landmark, while some railway termini are excellent examples of Victorian architecture, most notably St. Pancras and Paddington. The density of <this city> varies, with high employment density in the central area and Canary Wharf, high residential densities in inner <this city>, and lower densities in Outer <this city>.\n\nThe Monument in the City of <this city> provides views of the surrounding area while commemorating the Great Fire of <this city>, which originated nearby. Marble Arch and Wellington Arch, at the north and south ends of Park Lane, respectively, have royal connections, as do the Albert Memorial and Royal Albert Hall in Kensington. Nelson's Column (built to commemorate Admiral Horatio Nelson) is a nationally recognised monument in Trafalgar Square, one of the focal points of central <this city>. Older buildings are mainly brick, commonly the yellow <this city> stock brick.In the dense areas, most of the concentration is via medium- and high-rise buildings. <this city>'s skyscrapers, such as 30 St Mary Axe (dubbed \"The Gherkin\"), Tower 42, the Broadgate Tower and One Canada Square, are mostly in the two financial districts, the City of <this city> and Canary Wharf. High-rise development is restricted at certain sites if it would obstruct protected views of St Paul's Cathedral and other historic buildings. This protective policy, known as 'St Paul's Heights', has been in operation by the City of <this city> since 1937. Nevertheless, there are a number of tall skyscrapers in central <this city>, including the 95-storey Shard <this city> Bridge, the tallest building in the <this country> and Western Europe.Other notable modern buildings include The Scalpel, 20 Fenchurch Street (dubbed \"The Walkie-Talkie\"), the former City Hall in Southwark, the Art Deco BBC Broadcasting House plus the Postmodernist British Library in Somers Town/Kings Cross and No 1 Poultry by James Stirling. The BT Tower stands at 620 feet (189 m) and has a 360 degree coloured LED screen near the top. What was formerly the Millennium Dome, by the Thames to the east of Canary Wharf, is now an entertainment venue called the O2 Arena.\n\nNatural history\nThe <this city> Natural History Society suggests that <this city> is \"one of the World's Greenest Cities\" with more than 40 per cent green space or open water. They indicate that 2000 species of flowering plant have been found growing there and that the tidal Thames supports 120 species of fish. They state that over 60 species of bird nest in central <this city> and that their members have recorded 47 species of butterfly, 1173 moths and more than 270 kinds of spider around <this city>. <this city>'s wetland areas support nationally important populations of many water birds. <this city> has 38 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs), two national nature reserves and 76 local nature reserves.Amphibians are common in the capital, including smooth newts living by the Tate Modern, and common frogs, common toads, palmate newts and great crested newts. On the other hand, native reptiles such as slowworms, common lizards, barred grass snakes and adders, are mostly only seen in Outer <this city>.\nAmong other inhabitants of <this city> are 10,000 red foxes, so that there are now 16 foxes for every square mile (6 per square kilometre) of <this city>. Other mammals found in Greater <this city> are hedgehog, brown rat, mice, rabbit, shrew, vole, and grey squirrel. In wilder areas of Outer <this city>, such as Epping Forest, a wide variety of mammals are found, including European hare, badger, field, bank and water vole, wood mouse, yellow-necked mouse, mole, shrew, and weasel, in addition to red fox, grey squirrel and hedgehog. A dead otter was found at The Highway, in Wapping, about a mile from the Tower Bridge, which would suggest that they have begun to move back after being absent a hundred years from the city. Ten of England's eighteen species of bats have been recorded in Epping Forest: soprano, Nathusius' and common pipistrelles, common noctule, serotine, barbastelle, Daubenton's, brown long-eared, Natterer's and Leisler's.Herds of red and fallow deer roam freely within much of Richmond and Bushy Park. A cull takes place each November and February to ensure numbers can be sustained. Epping Forest is also known for its fallow deer, which can frequently be seen in herds to the north of the Forest. A rare population of melanistic, black fallow deer is also maintained at the Deer Sanctuary near Theydon Bois. Muntjac deer are also found in the forest. While <this city>ers are accustomed to wildlife such as birds and foxes sharing the city, more recently urban deer have started becoming a regular feature, and whole herds of fallow deer come into residential areas at night to take advantage of <this city>'s green spaces.\n\nDemography\nThe 2021 census recorded that 3,575,739 people or 40.6% of <this city>'s population were foreign-born making it the city with the second largest immigrant population after New York City, in terms of absolute numbers. About 69% of children born in <this city> in 2015 had at least one parent who was born abroad.The population then grew by just over a million between the 2001 and 2011 Censuses, to reach 8,173,941 in the latter. <this city>'s continuous urban area extends beyond Greater <this city> and numbered 9,787,426 people in 2011, while its wider metropolitan area had a population of 12\u201314 million, depending on the definition used. According to Eurostat, <this city> is the second most populous metropolitan area in Europe. A net 726,000 immigrants arrived there in the period 1991\u20132001.The region covers 610 square miles (1,579 km2), giving a population density of 13,410 inhabitants per square mile (5,177/km2) more than ten times that of any other British region.

In January 2005, a survey of <this city>'s ethnic and religious diversity claimed that more than 300 languages were spoken in <this city> and more than 50 non-indigenous communities had populations of more than 10,000. Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that in 2021, <this city>'s foreign-born population was 3,346,000 (35%), up from 1,630,000 in 1997.The 2011 census showed that 36.7% of Greater <this city>'s population were born outside the UK. Estimates by the Office for National Statistics indicate that the five largest foreign-born groups living in <this city> from July 2009 to June 2010 were born in India, Poland, the Republic of Ireland, Bangladesh and Nigeria.

The well-known St Paul's Cathedral in the City and Southwark Cathedral south of the river are Anglican administrative centres, while the Archbishop of Canterbury, principal bishop of the Church of England and worldwide Anglican Communion, has his main residence at Lambeth Palace in the <this city> Borough of Lambeth.\n\nImportant national and royal ceremonies are shared between St Paul's and Westminster Abbey. The Abbey is not to be confused with nearby Westminster Cathedral, the largest Roman Catholic cathedral in England and Wales. Despite the prevalence of Anglican churches, observance is low within the denomination. Anglican Church attendance continues a long, steady decline, according to Church of England statistics.Notable mosques include the East <this city> Mosque in Tower Hamlets, which is allowed to give the Islamic call to prayer through loudspeakers, the <this city> Central Mosque on the edge of Regent's Park and the Baitul Futuh of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. After the oil boom, increasing numbers of wealthy Middle-Eastern Arab Muslims based themselves around Mayfair, Kensington and Knightsbridge in West <this city>. There are large Bengali Muslim communities in the eastern boroughs of Tower Hamlets and Newham.Large Hindu communities are found in the north-western boroughs of Harrow and Brent, the latter hosting what was until 2006 Europe's largest Hindu temple, Neasden Temple. <this city> is home to 44 Hindu temples, including the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir <this city>. There are Sikh communities in East and West <this city>, particularly in Southall, home to one of the largest Sikh populations and the largest Sikh temple outside India.The majority of British Jews live in <this city>, with notable Jewish communities in Stamford Hill, Stanmore, Golders Green, Finchley, Hampstead, Hendon and Edgware, all in North <this city>. Bevis Marks Synagogue in the City of <this city> is affiliated to <this city>'s historic Sephardic Jewish community. It is the only synagogue in Europe to have held regular services continually for over 300 years. Stanmore and Canons Park Synagogue has the largest membership of any Orthodox synagogue in Europe. The <this city> Jewish Forum was set up in 2006 in response to the growing significance of devolved <this city> Government.\n\nAccents\nCockney is an accent heard across <this city>, mainly spoken by working-class and lower-middle class <this city>ers. It is mainly attributed to the East End and wider East <this city>, having originated there in the 18th century, although it has been suggested that the Cockney style of speech is much older. Some features of Cockney include, Th-fronting (pronouncing \"th\" as \"f\"), \"th\" inside a word is pronounced with a \"v\" , H-dropping, and, like most English accents, a Cockney accent drops the \"r\" after a vowel. John Camden Hotten, in his Slang Dictionary of 1859, makes reference to Cockney \"use of a peculiar slang language\" (Cockney rhyming slang) when describing the costermongers of the East End. Since the start of the 21st century the extreme form of the Cockney dialect is less common in parts of the East End itself, with modern strongholds including other parts of <this city> and suburbs in the home counties.Estuary English is an intermediate accent between Cockney and Received Pronunciation. It is widely spoken by people of all classes.Multicultural <this city> English (MLE) is a multiethnolect becoming increasingly common in multicultural areas amongst young, working-class people from diverse backgrounds. It is a fusion of an array of ethnic accents, in particular Afro-Caribbean and South Asian, with a significant Cockney influence.Received Pronunciation (RP) is the accent traditionally regarded as the standard for British English. It has no specific geographical correlate, although it is also traditionally defined as the standard speech used in <this city> and south-eastern England. It is mainly spoken by upper-class and upper-middle class <this city>ers.\n\nEconomy\n<this city>'s gross regional product in 2019 was \u00a3503 billion, around a quarter of UK GDP. <this city> has five major business districts: the city, Westminster, Canary Wharf, Camden & Islington and Lambeth & Southwark. One way to get an idea of their relative importance is to look at relative amounts of office space: Greater <this city> had 27 million m2 of office space in 2001, and the City contains the most space, with 8 million m2 of office space. <this city> has some of the highest real estate prices in the world. <this city> is the world's most expensive office market according to world property journal (2015) report. As of 2015 the residential property in <this city> is worth $2.2 trillion. The city has the highest property prices of any European city according to the Office for National Statistics and the European Office of Statistics. On average the price per square metre in central <this city> is \u20ac24,252 (April 2014). This is higher than the property prices in other G8 European capital cities.\n\nCity of <this city>\n<this city>'s finance industry is based in the City of <this city> and Canary Wharf, the two major business districts. <this city> is one of the pre-eminent financial centres of the world as the most important location for international finance. <this city> took over as a major financial centre shortly after 1795 when the Dutch Republic collapsed before the Napoleonic armies. For many bankers established in Amsterdam (e.g. Hope, Baring), this was only time to move to <this city>. Also, <this city>'s market-centred system (as opposed to the bank-centred one in Amsterdam) grew more dominant in the 18th century. The <this city> financial elite was strengthened by a strong Jewish community from all over Europe capable of mastering the most sophisticated financial tools of the time. This economic strength of the city was attributed to its diversity.\nBy the mid-19th century, <this city> was the leading financial centre, and at the end of the century over half the world's trade was financed in British currency. Still, as of 2016 <this city> tops the world rankings on the Global Financial Centres Index (GFCI), and it ranked second in A.T. Kearney's 2018 Global Cities Index.<this city>'s largest industry is finance, and its financial exports make it a large contributor to the UK's balance of payments. Around 325,000 people were employed in financial services in <this city> until mid-2007. <this city> has over 480 overseas banks, more than any other city in the world. It is the world's biggest currency trading centre, accounting for some 37 per cent of the $5.1 trillion average daily volume, according to the BIS. Over 85 per cent (3.2 million) of the employed population of greater <this city> works in the services industries. Because of its prominent global role, <this city>'s economy had been affected by the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008. However, by 2010 the city had recovered, put in place new regulatory powers, proceeded to regain lost ground and re-established <this city>'s economic dominance. Along with professional services headquarters, the City of <this city> is home to the Bank of England, <this city> Stock Exchange, and Lloyd's of <this city> insurance market.Over half the UK's top 100 listed companies (the FTSE 100) and over 100 of Europe's 500 largest companies have their headquarters in central <this city>. Over 70 per cent of the FTSE 100 are within <this city>'s metropolitan area, and 75 per cent of Fortune 500 companies have offices in <this city>. In a 1992 report commissioned by the <this city> Stock Exchange, Sir Adrian Cadbury, chairman of his family's confectionery company Cadbury, produced the Cadbury Report, a code of best practice which served as a basis for reform of corporate governance around the world.\n\nMedia and technology\nMedia companies are concentrated in <this city>, and the media distribution industry is <this city>'s second most competitive sector. The BBC, the world's oldest national broadcaster, is a significant employer, while other broadcasters also have headquarters around the city. Many national newspapers, including The Times, founded in 1785, are edited in <this city>; the term Fleet Street (where most national newspapers operated) remains a metonym for the British national press. <this city> is a major retail centre and in 2010 had the highest non-food retail sales of any city in the world, with a total spend of around \u00a364.2 billion. The Port of <this city> is the second largest in the UK, handling 45 million tonnes of cargo each year.A growing number of technology companies are based in <this city>, notably in East <this city> Tech City, also known as Silicon Roundabout. In 2014 the city was among the first to receive a geoTLD. In February 2014 <this city> was ranked as the European City of the Future in the 2014/15 list by fDi Intelligence. A museum in Bletchley Park, where Alan Turing was based during World War II, is in Bletchley, 40 miles (64 km) north of central <this city>, as is The National Museum of Computing.The gas and electricity distribution networks that manage and operate the towers, cables and pressure systems that deliver energy to consumers across the city are managed by National Grid plc, SGN and UK Power Networks.\n\nTourism\n<this city> is one of the leading tourist destinations in the world and in 2015 was ranked as the most visited city in the world with over 65 million visits.

In 2007 the Mayor of <this city> assumed responsibility for some local lines, which now form the <this city> Overground network, adding to the existing responsibility for the <this city> Underground, trams and buses. The public transport network is administered by Transport for <this city> (TfL).The lines that formed the <this city> Underground, as well as trams and buses, became part of an integrated transport system in 1933 when the <this city> Passenger Transport Board or <this city> Transport was created. Transport for <this city> is now the statutory corporation responsible for most aspects of the transport system in Greater <this city>, and is run by a board and a commissioner appointed by the Mayor of <this city>.\n\nAviation\n<this city> is a major international air transport hub with the busiest city airspace in the world. Eight airports use the word <this city> in their name, but most traffic passes through six of these. Additionally, various other airports also serve <this city>, catering primarily to general aviation flights.\n\nHeathrow Airport, in Hillingdon, West <this city>, was for many years the busiest airport in the world for international traffic, and is the major hub of the nation's flag carrier, British Airways.

In 2017, international passengers made up over 95% of the total at Southend, the highest proportion of any <this city> airport.\n\nRail\nUnderground and DLR\nOpened in 1863, the <this city> Underground, commonly referred to as the Tube or just the Underground, is the oldest and third longest metro system in the world. The system serves 272 stations, and was formed from several private companies, including the world's first underground electric line, the City and South <this city> Railway, which opened in 1890.Over four million journeys are made every day on the Underground network, over 1 billion each year. An investment programme is attempting to reduce congestion and improve reliability, including \u00a36.5 billion (\u20ac7.7 billion) spent before the 2012 Summer Olympics. The Docklands Light Railway (DLR), which opened in 1987, is a second, more local metro system using smaller and lighter tram-type vehicles that serve the Docklands, Greenwich and Lewisham.\n\nSuburban\nThere are 368 railway stations in the <this city> Travelcard Zones on an extensive above-ground suburban railway network. South <this city>, particularly, has a high concentration of railways as it has fewer Underground lines. Most rail lines terminate around the centre of <this city>, running into eighteen terminal stations, with the exception of the Thameslink trains connecting Bedford in the north and Brighton in the south via Luton and Gatwick airports. <this city> has Britain's busiest station by number of passengers\u2014Waterloo, with over 184 million people using the interchange station complex (which includes Waterloo East station) each year. Clapham Junction is one of Europe's busiest rail interchanges.With the need for more rail capacity, the Elizabeth Line (also known as Crossrail) opened in May 2022. It is a new railway line running east to west through <this city> and into the Home Counties with a branch to Heathrow Airport. It was Europe's biggest construction project, with a \u00a315 billion projected cost.\n\nInter-city and international\n<this city> is the centre of the National Rail network, with 70 per cent of rail journeys starting or ending in <this city>. King's Cross station and Euston station, both in <this city>, are the starting points of the East Coast Main Line and the West Coast Main Line \u2013 the two main railway lines in Britain. Like suburban rail services, regional and inter-city trains depart from several termini around the city centre, directly linking <this city> with most of Great Britain's major cities and towns. The Flying Scotsman is an express passenger train service that has operated between <this city> and Edinburgh since 1862; the world famous steam locomotive named after this service, Flying Scotsman, was the first locomotive to reach the officially authenticated speed of 100 miles per hour (161 km/h) in 1934.Some international railway services to Continental Europe were operated during the 20th century as boat trains. The opening of the Channel Tunnel in 1994 connected <this city> directly to the continental rail network, allowing Eurostar services to begin. Since 2007, high-speed trains link St. Pancras International with Lille, Calais, Paris, Disneyland Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam and other European tourist destinations via the High Speed 1 rail link and the Channel Tunnel.

The Woolwich Ferry, with 2.5 million passengers every year, is a frequent service linking the North and South Circular Roads.\n\nRoads\nAlthough the majority of journeys in central <this city> are made by public transport, car travel is common in the suburbs. The inner ring road (around the city centre), the North and South Circular roads (just within the suburbs), and the outer orbital motorway (the M25, just outside the built-up area in most places) encircle the city and are intersected by a number of busy radial routes\u2014but very few motorways penetrate into inner <this city>.
