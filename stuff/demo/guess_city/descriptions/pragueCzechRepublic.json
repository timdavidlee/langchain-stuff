  "wiki_text": "<this city> ( PRAHG; Czech: Praha [\u02c8pra\u0266a] (listen); German: Prag, pronounced [p\u0281a\u02d0k] (listen); Latin: Praga) is the capital and largest city of the <this country>, and the historical capital of Bohemia. On the Vltava river, <this city> is home to about 1.3 million people. The city has a temperate oceanic climate, with relatively warm summers and chilly winters.\n<this city> is a political, cultural, and economic hub of central Europe, with a rich history and Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque architectures. It was the capital of the Kingdom of Bohemia and residence of several Holy Roman Emperors, most notably Charles IV (r. 1346\u20131378).It was an important city to the Habsburg monarchy and Austro-Hungarian Empire. The city played major roles in the Bohemian and the Protestant Reformations, the Thirty Years' War and in 20th-century history as the capital of Czechoslovakia between the World Wars and the post-war Communist era.<this city> is home to a number of well-known cultural attractions, many of which survived the violence and destruction of 20th-century Europe. Main attractions include <this city> Castle, Charles Bridge, Old Town Square with the <this city> astronomical clock, the Jewish Quarter, Pet\u0159\u00edn hill and Vy\u0161ehrad. Since 1992, the historic center of <this city> has been included in the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites.\nThe city has more than ten major museums, along with numerous theaters, galleries, cinemas, and other historical exhibits. An extensive modern public transportation system connects the city. It is home to a wide range of public and private schools, including Charles University in <this city>, the oldest university in Central Europe.<this city> is classified as a \"Beta+\" global city according to GaWC studies. In 2019, the city was ranked as 69th most livable city in the world by Mercer. In the same year, the PICSA Index ranked the city as 13th most livable city in the world. Its rich history makes it a popular tourist destination and as of 2017, the city receives more than 8.5 million international visitors annually. In 2017, <this city> was listed as the fifth most visited European city after London, Paris, Rome, and Istanbul.\n\nEtymology and names\nThe Czech name Praha is derived from an old Slavic word, pr\u00e1h, which means \"ford\" or \"rapid\", referring to the city's origin at a crossing point of the Vltava river. The same etymology is associated with the Praga district of Warsaw.Another view to the origin of the name is also related to the Czech word pr\u00e1h (with the meaning of a threshold) and a legendary etymology connects the name of the city with princess Libu\u0161e, prophetess and a wife of mythical founder of the P\u0159emyslid dynasty. She is said to have ordered the city \"to be built where a man hews a threshold of his house\". The Czech pr\u00e1h might thus be understood to refer to rapids or fords in the river, the edge of which could have acted as a means of fording the river \u2013 thus providing a \"threshold\" to the castle.\nAnother derivation of the name Praha is suggested from na praz\u011b, the original term for the shale hillside rock upon which the original castle was built. At that time, the castle was surrounded by forests, covering the nine hills of the future city \u2013 the Old Town on the opposite side of the river, as well as the Lesser Town beneath the existing castle, appeared only later.The English spelling of the city's name is borrowed from French. In the 19th and early 20th centuries it was pronounced in English to rhyme with \"vague\": it was so pronounced by Lady Diana Cooper (born 1892) on Desert Island Discs in 1969, and it is written to rhyme with \"vague\" in a verse of The Beleaguered City by Longfellow (1839) and also in the limerick There was an Old Lady of <this city> by Edward Lear (1846).\n<this city> is also called the \"City of a Hundred Spires\", based on a count by 19th century mathematician Bernard Bolzano; today's count is estimated by the <this city> Information Service at 500. Nicknames for <this city> have also included: the Golden City, the Mother of Cities and the Heart of Europe.\n\nHistory\nDuring the thousand years of its existence, <this city> has grown from a settlement stretching from <this city> Castle in the north to the fort of Vy\u0161ehrad in the south, to become the capital of a modern European country.\n\nEarly history\nThe region was settled as early as the Paleolithic age. Jewish chronicler David Solomon Ganz, citing Cyriacus Spangenberg, claimed that the city was founded as Boihaem in c.\u20091306 BC by an ancient king, Boyya.Around the fifth and fourth century BC, a Celtic tribe appeared in the area, later establishing settlements, including the largest Celtic oppidum in Bohemia, Z\u00e1vist, in a present-day south suburb Zbraslav in <this city>, and naming the region of Bohemia, which means \"home of the Boii people\". In the last century BC, the Celts were slowly driven away by Germanic tribes (Marcomanni, Quadi, Lombards and possibly the Suebi), leading some to place the seat of the Marcomanni king, Maroboduus, in Z\u00e1vist. Around the area where present-day <this city> stands, the 2nd century map drawn by Ptolemaios mentioned a Germanic city called Casurgis.In the late 5th century AD, during the great Migration Period following the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, the Germanic tribes living in Bohemia moved westwards and, probably in the 6th century, the Slavic tribes (Venedi) settled the Central Bohemian Region. In the following three centuries, the Czech tribes built several fortified settlements in the area, most notably in the \u0160\u00e1rka valley, Butovice and Lev\u00fd Hradec.\nThe construction of what came to be known as <this city> Castle began near the end of the 9th century, expanding a fortified settlement that had existed on the site since the year 800. The first masonry under <this city> Castle dates from the year 885 at the latest. The other prominent <this city> fort, the P\u0159emyslid fort Vy\u0161ehrad, was founded in the 10th century, some 70 years later than <this city> Castle. <this city> Castle is dominated by the cathedral, which began construction in 1344, but was not completed until the 20th century.The legendary origins of <this city> attribute its foundation to the 8th-century Czech duchess and prophetess Libu\u0161e and her husband, P\u0159emysl, founder of the P\u0159emyslid dynasty. Legend says that Libu\u0161e came out on a rocky cliff high above the Vltava and prophesied: \"I see a great city whose glory will touch the stars\". She ordered a castle and a town called Praha to be built on the site.The region became the seat of the dukes, and later kings of Bohemia. Under Duke of Bohemia Boleslaus II the Pious the area became a bishopric in 973. Until <this city> was elevated to archbishopric in 1344, it was under the jurisdiction of the Archbishopric of Mainz.<this city> was an important seat for trading where merchants from across Europe settled, including many Jews, as recalled in 965 by the Hispano-Jewish merchant and traveler Abraham ben Jacob. The Old New Synagogue of 1270 still stands in the city. <this city> was also once home to an important slave market.At the site of the ford in the Vltava river, King Vladislaus I had the first bridge built in 1170, the Judith Bridge (Juditin most), named in honor of his wife Judith of Thuringia. This bridge was destroyed by a flood in 1342, but some of the original foundation stones of that bridge remain in the river. It was rebuilt and named the Charles Bridge.In 1257, under King Ottokar II, Mal\u00e1 Strana (\"Lesser Quarter\") was founded in <this city> on the site of an older village in what would become the Hrad\u010dany (<this city> Castle) area. This was the district of the German people, who had the right to administer the law autonomously, pursuant to Magdeburg rights. The new district was on the bank opposite of the Star\u00e9 M\u011bsto (\"Old Town\"), which had borough status and was bordered by a line of walls and fortifications.\n\nLate Middle Ages\n<this city> flourished during the 14th-century reign (1346\u20131378) of Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor and the king of Bohemia of the new Luxembourg dynasty. As King of Bohemia and Holy Roman Emperor, he transformed <this city> into an imperial capital. In the 1470s, <this city> had around 70,000 inhabitants and with an area of 360 ha (~1.4 square miles) it was the third-largest city in the Holy Roman Empire.Charles IV ordered the building of the New Town (Nov\u00e9 M\u011bsto) adjacent to the Old Town and laid out the design himself. The Charles Bridge, replacing the Judith Bridge destroyed in the flood just prior to his reign, was erected to connect the east bank districts to the Mal\u00e1 Strana and castle area. In 1347, he founded Charles University, which remains the oldest university in Central Europe.\nHe began construction of the Gothic Saint Vitus Cathedral, within the largest of the <this city> Castle courtyards, on the site of the Romanesque rotunda there. <this city> was elevated to an archbishopric in 1344, the year the cathedral was begun.\nThe city had a mint and was a center of trade for German and Italian bankers and merchants. The social order, however, became more turbulent due to the rising power of the craftsmen's guilds (themselves often torn by internal conflicts), and the increasing number of poor.\nThe Hunger Wall, a substantial fortification wall south of Mal\u00e1 Strana and the castle area, was built during a famine in the 1360s. The work is reputed to have been ordered by Charles IV as a means of providing employment and food to the workers and their families.\nCharles IV died in 1378. During the reign of his son, King Wenceslaus IV (1378\u20131419), a period of intense turmoil ensued. During Easter 1389, members of the <this city> clergy announced that Jews had desecrated the host (Eucharistic wafer) and the clergy encouraged mobs to pillage, ransack and burn the Jewish quarter. Nearly the entire Jewish population of <this city> (3,000 people) was murdered.\nIn 1400, <this city> had 95,000 inhabitants, making it the third largest city in Europe (after Paris and Venice). Jan Hus, a theologian and rector at the Charles University, preached in <this city>. In 1402, he began giving sermons in the Bethlehem Chapel. Inspired by John Wycliffe, these sermons focused on what were seen as radical reforms of a corrupt Church. Having become too dangerous for the political and religious establishment, Hus was summoned to the Council of Constance, put on trial for heresy, and burned at the stake in Constanz in 1415.\nFour years later <this city> experienced its first defenestration, when the people rebelled under the command of the <this city> priest Jan \u017delivsk\u00fd. Hus' death, coupled with Czech proto-nationalism and proto-Protestantism, had spurred the Hussite Wars. Peasant rebels, led by the general Jan \u017di\u017eka, along with Hussite troops from <this city>, defeated Emperor Sigismund, in the Battle of V\u00edtkov Hill in 1420.\nDuring the Hussite Wars when <this city> was attacked by \"Crusader\" and mercenary forces, the city militia fought bravely under the <this city> Banner. This swallow-tailed banner is approximately 4 by 6 ft (1.2 by 1.8 m), with a red field sprinkled with small white fleurs-de-lis, and a silver old Town Coat-of-Arms in the center. The words \"P\u00c1N B\u016eH POMOC NA\u0160E\" (The Lord is our Relief/Help) appeared above the coat-of-arms, with a Hussite chalice centered on the top. Near the swallow-tails is a crescent-shaped golden sun with rays protruding.\nOne of these banners was captured by Swedish troops during the Battle of <this city> (1648), when they captured the western bank of the Vltava river and were repulsed from the eastern bank, they placed it in the Royal Military Museum in Stockholm; although this flag still exists, it is in very poor condition. They also took the Codex Gigas and the Codex Argenteus. The earliest evidence indicates that a gonfalon with a municipal charge painted on it was used for the Old Town as early as 1419. Since this city militia flag was in use before 1477 and during the Hussite Wars, it is the oldest still preserved municipal flag of Bohemia.In the following two centuries, <this city> strengthened its role as a merchant city. Many noteworthy Gothic buildings were erected and Vladislav Hall of the <this city> Castle was added.\n\nHabsburg era\nIn 1526, the Bohemian estates elected Ferdinand I of the House of Habsburg. The fervent Catholicism of its members brought them into conflict in Bohemia, and then in <this city>, where Protestant ideas were gaining popularity. These problems were not preeminent under Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II, elected King of Bohemia in 1576, who chose <this city> as his home. He lived in the <this city> Castle, where his court welcomed not only astrologers and magicians but also scientists, musicians, and artists. Rudolf was an art lover as well, and <this city> became the capital of European culture. This was a prosperous period for the city: famous people living there in that age include the astronomers Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler, the painter Arcimboldo, the alchemists Edward Kelley and John Dee, the poet Elizabeth Jane Weston, and others.\nIn 1618, the famous second defenestration of <this city> provoked the Thirty Years' War, a particularly harsh period for <this city> and Bohemia. Ferdinand II of Habsburg was deposed, and his place as King of Bohemia taken by Frederick V, Elector Palatine; however his army was crushed in the Battle of White Mountain (1620) not far from the city. Following this in 1621 was an execution of 27 Czech Protestant leaders (involved in the uprising) in Old Town Square and the exiling of many others. <this city> was forcibly converted back to Roman Catholicism followed by the rest of Czech lands. The city suffered subsequently during the war under an attack by Electorate of Saxony (1631) and during the Battle of <this city> (1648). <this city> began a steady decline which reduced the population from the 60,000 it had had in the years before the war to 20,000. In the second half of the 17th century, <this city>'s population began to grow again. Jews had been in <this city> since the end of the 10th century and, by 1708, they accounted for about a quarter of <this city>'s population.In 1689, a great fire devastated <this city>, but this spurred a renovation and a rebuilding of the city. In 1713\u201314, a major outbreak of plague hit <this city> one last time, killing 12,000 to 13,000 people.\nIn 1744, Frederick the Great of Prussia invaded Bohemia. He took <this city> after a severe and prolonged siege in the course of which a large part of the town was destroyed. Empress Maria Theresa expelled the Jews from <this city> in 1745; though she rescinded the expulsion in 1748, the proportion of Jewish residents in the city never recovered.  In 1757 the Prussian bombardment destroyed more than one quarter of the city and heavily damaged St. Vitus Cathedral. However a month later, Frederick the Great was defeated and forced to retreat from Bohemia.\nThe economy of <this city> continued to improve during the 18th century. The population increased to 80,000 inhabitants by 1771. Many rich merchants and nobles enhanced the city with a host of palaces, churches and gardens full of art and music, creating a Baroque city renowned throughout the world to this day.\nIn 1784, under Joseph II, the four municipalities of Mal\u00e1 Strana, Nov\u00e9 M\u011bsto, Star\u00e9 M\u011bsto, and Hrad\u010dany were merged into a single entity. The Jewish district, called Josefov, was included only in 1850. The Industrial Revolution produced great changes and developments in <this city>, as new factories could take advantage of the coal mines and ironworks of the nearby regions. A first suburb, Karl\u00edn, was created in 1817, and twenty years later the population exceeded 100,000.\nThe revolutions in Europe in 1848 also touched <this city>, but they were fiercely suppressed. In the following years, the Czech National Revival began its rise, until it gained the majority in the town council in 1861. <this city> had a German-speaking majority in 1848, but by 1880 the number of German speakers had decreased to 14% (42,000), and by 1910 to 6.7% (37,000), due to a massive increase of the city's overall population caused by the influx of Czechs from the rest of Bohemia and Moravia and the increasing prestige and importance of the Czech language as part of the Czech National Revival.\n\n20th century\nFirst Czechoslovak Republic\nWorld War I ended with the defeat of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the creation of Czechoslovakia. <this city> was chosen as its capital and <this city> Castle as the seat of president Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk. At this time <this city> was a true European capital with highly developed industry. By 1930, the population had risen to 850,000.\n\nSecond World War\nHitler ordered the German Army to enter <this city> on 15 March 1939, and from <this city> Castle proclaimed Bohemia and Moravia a German protectorate. For most of its history, <this city> had been a multi-ethnic city with important Czech, German and (mostly native German-speaking) Jewish populations. From 1939, when the country was occupied by Nazi Germany, Hitler took over <this city> Castle. During the Second World War, most Jews were deported and killed by the Germans. In 1942, <this city> was witness to the assassination of one of the most powerful men in Nazi Germany\u2014Reinhard Heydrich\u2014during Operation Anthropoid, accomplished by Czechoslovak national heroes Jozef Gab\u010d\u00edk and Jan Kubi\u0161. Hitler ordered bloody reprisals.In February 1945, <this city> suffered several bombing raids by the US Army Air Forces. 701 people were killed, more than 1,000 people were injured and some buildings, factories and historic landmarks (Emmaus Monastery, Faust House, Vinohrady Synagogue) were destroyed. Many historic structures in <this city>, however, escaped the destruction of the war and the damage was small compared to the total destruction of many other cities in that time. According to American pilots, it was the result of a navigational mistake. In March, a deliberate raid targeted military factories in <this city>, killing about 370 people.On 5 May 1945, two days before Germany capitulated, an uprising against Germany occurred. Several thousand Czechs were killed in four days of bloody street fighting, with many atrocities committed by both sides. At daybreak on 9 May, the 3rd Shock Army of the Red Army took the city almost unopposed. The majority (about 50,000 people) of the German population of <this city> either fled or were expelled by the Bene\u0161 decrees in the aftermath of the war.\n\nCold War\n<this city> was a city in a country under the military, economic, and political control of the Soviet Union (see Iron Curtain and COMECON). The world's largest Stalin Monument was unveiled on Letn\u00e1 hill in 1955 and destroyed in 1962.\nThe 4th Czechoslovak Writers' Congress, held in the city in June 1967, took a strong position against the regime. On 31 October 1967 students demonstrated at Strahov. This spurred the new secretary of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, Alexander Dub\u010dek, to proclaim a new deal in his city's and country's life, starting the short-lived season of the \"socialism with a human face\". It was the <this city> Spring, which aimed at the renovation of political institutions in a democratic way. The other Warsaw Pact member countries, except Romania and Albania, were led by the Soviet Union to repress these reforms through the invasion of Czechoslovakia and the capital, <this city>, on 21 August 1968. The invasion, chiefly by infantry and tanks, effectively suppressed any further attempts at reform. The military occupation of Czechoslovakia by the Red Army would end only in 1991. Jan Palach and Jan Zaj\u00edc committed suicide by self-immolation in January and February 1969 to protest against the \"normalization\" of the country.\n\nAfter the Velvet Revolution\nIn 1989, after riot police beat back a peaceful student demonstration, the Velvet Revolution crowded the streets of <this city>, and the capital of Czechoslovakia benefited greatly from the new mood. In 1993, after the Velvet Divorce, <this city> became the capital city of the new <this country>. From 1995 high-rise buildings began to be built in <this city> in large quantities. In the late 1990s, <this city> again became an important cultural center of Europe and was notably influenced by globalisation. In 2000, the IMF and World Bank summits took place in <this city> and anti-globalization riots took place here. In 2002, <this city> suffered from widespread floods that damaged buildings and its underground transport system.\n<this city> launched a bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics, but failed to make the candidate city shortlist. In June 2009, as the result of financial pressures from the global recession, <this city>'s officials chose to cancel the city's planned bid for the 2020 Summer Olympics.\n\nGeography\n<this city> is situated on the Vltava river. The Berounka flows into the Vltava in the suburbs of Lahovice. There are 99 watercourses in <this city> with a total length of 340 km (210 mi). The longest streams are Rokytka and Boti\u010d.There are 3 reservoirs, 37 ponds, and 34 retention reservoirs and dry polders in the city. The largest pond is Velk\u00fd Po\u010dernick\u00fd with 41.76 ha (103.2 acres). The largest body of water is Hostiva\u0159 Reservoir with 42 hectares (103.8 acres).In terms of geomorphological division, most of <this city> is located in the <this city> Plateau. In the south the city's territory extends into the Ho\u0159ovice Uplands, in the north it extends into the Central Elbe Table lowland. The highest point is the top of the hill Tele\u010dek on the western border of <this city>, at 399 m (1,309 ft) above sea level. Notable hills in the centre of <this city> are Pet\u0159\u00edn with 327 m (1,073 ft) and V\u00edtkov with 270 m (890 ft). The lowest point is the Vltava in Suchdol at the place where it leaves the city, at 172 m (564 ft).<this city> is located approximately at 50\u00b05\u2032N 14\u00b025\u2032E. <this city> is approximately at the same latitude as Frankfurt, Germany; Paris, France; and Vancouver, Canada. The northernmost point is at 50\u00b010\u203239\u2033N 14\u00b031\u203237\u2033E, the southernmost point is at 49\u00b056\u203231\u2033N 14\u00b023\u203244\u2033E, the westernmost point is at 50\u00b06\u203214\u2033N 14\u00b013\u203231\u2033E, and the easternmost point is at 50\u00b05\u203214\u2033N 14\u00b042\u203223\u2033E.\n\nClimate\n<this city> has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb) with humid continental (Dfb) influences, defined as such by the 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) isotherm. The winters are relatively cold with average temperatures at about freezing point, and with very little sunshine. Snow cover can be common between mid-November and late March although snow accumulations of more than 200 mm (8 in) are infrequent. There are also a few periods of mild temperatures in winter. Summers usually bring plenty of sunshine and the average high temperature of 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F). Nights can be quite cool even in summer, though. Precipitation in <this city> is rather low (just over 500 mm or 20 in per year) since it is located in the rain shadow of the Sudetes and other mountain ranges. The driest season is usually winter while late spring and summer can bring quite heavy rain, especially in form of thundershowers. Temperature inversions are relatively common between mid-October and mid-March bringing foggy, cold days and sometimes moderate air pollution. <this city> is also a windy city with common sustained western winds and an average wind speed of 16 km/h (10 mph) that often help break temperature inversions and clear the air in cold months.\n\nAdministration\nAdministrative division\n<this city> is the capital of the <this country> and as such is the regular seat of its central authorities. Since 24 November 1990, it is de facto again a statutory city, but has a specific status of the municipality and the region at the same time. <this city> also houses the administrative institutions of the Central Bohemian Region.\n\nUntil 1949, all administrative districts of <this city> were formed by the whole one or more cadastral unit, municipality or town. Since 1949, there has been a fundamental change in the administrative division. Since then, the boundaries of many urban districts, administrative districts and city districts are independent of the boundaries of cadastral territories and some cadastral territories are thus divided into administrative and self-governing parts of the city. Cadastral area (for example, Vinohrady and Sm\u00edchov) are still relevant especially for the registration of land and real estate and house numbering.\n<this city> is divided into 10 municipal districts (1\u201310), 22 administrative districts (1\u201322), 57 municipal parts, and 112 cadastral areas.\n\nCity government\n<this city> is autonomously administered by the <this city> City Assembly, which is elected through municipal elections and consists of 65 members. Executive body of <this city>, elected by the Assembly is a <this city> City Council. The municipal office of <this city> is called <this city> City Hall. It has 11 members including the mayor and it prepares proposals for the Assembly meetings and ensures that adopted resolutions are fulfilled. The Mayor of <this city> is Civic Democratic Party member Bohuslav Svoboda.\n\nDemographics\n2011 census\nEven though the official population of <this city> hovers around 1.3 million as of the 2011 census, the city's real population is much higher due to only 65% of its residents being marked as permanently living in the city. Data taken from mobile phone movements around the city suggest that the real population of <this city> is closer to 1.9 or 2.0 million, with an additional 300,000 to 400,000 commuters coming to the city on weekdays for work, education, or commerce.About 14% of the city's inhabitants were born outside the <this country>, the highest proportion in the country. However, 64.8% of the city's population self-identified as ethnically Czech, which is slightly higher than the national average of 63.7%. Almost 29% of respondents declined to answer the question on ethnicity at all, so it may be assumed that the real percentage of ethnic Czechs in <this city> is considerably higher. The largest ethnic minority are Slovaks, followed by Ukrainians and Russians.<this city>'s population is the oldest and best-educated in the country. It has the lowest proportion of children. Only 10.8% of census respondents claimed adherence to a religion; the majority of these were Roman Catholics.\n\nHistorical population\nDevelopment of the <this city> population since 1378 (since 1869 according to the censuses within the limits of present-day <this city>):\n\nForeign residents\nAs of 31 March 2023, there were 325,336 foreign residents in <this city>, of which 118,996 with permanent residence in <this city>. The following nationalities are the most numerous:\n\nCulture\nThe city is traditionally one of the cultural centres of Europe, hosting many cultural events.
