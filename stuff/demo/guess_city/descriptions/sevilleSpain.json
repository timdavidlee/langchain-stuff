  "wiki_text": "<this city> ( s\u0259-VIL; Spanish: Sevilla, pronounced [se\u02c8\u03b2i\u028ea] (listen)) is the capital and largest city of the Spanish autonomous community of Andalusia and the province of <this city>. It is situated on the lower reaches of the River Guadalquivir, in the southwest of the Iberian Peninsula.\n<this city> has a municipal population of about 701,000  as of 2022, and a metropolitan population of about 1.5 million, making it the largest city in Andalusia, the fourth-largest city in <this country> and the 26th most populous municipality in the European Union. Its old town, with an area of 4 square kilometres (2 sq mi), contains a UNESCO World Heritage Site comprising three buildings: the Alc\u00e1zar palace complex, the Cathedral and the General Archive of the Indies. The <this city> harbour, located about 80 kilometres (50 miles) from the Atlantic Ocean, is the only river port in <this country>. The capital of Andalusia features hot temperatures in the summer, with daily maximums routinely above 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F) in July and August.\n<this city> was founded as the Roman city of Hispalis. Known as Ishbiliyah after the Islamic conquest in 711, <this city> became the centre of the independent Taifa of <this city> following the collapse of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba in the early 11th century; later it was ruled by Almoravids and Almohads until being incorporated to the Crown of Castile in 1248. Owing to its role as gateway of the Spanish Empire's trans-atlantic trade, managed from the Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n, <this city> became one of the largest cities in Western Europe in the 16th century. Coinciding with the Baroque period, the 17th century in <this city> represented the most brilliant flowering of the city's culture; then began a gradual economic and demographic decline as silting in the Guadalquivir forced the trade monopoly to relocate to the nearby port of C\u00e1diz.\nThe 20th century in <this city> saw the tribulations of the Spanish Civil War, decisive cultural milestones such as the Ibero-American Exposition of 1929 and Expo '92, and the city's election as the capital of the Autonomous Community of Andalusia.\n\nName\nOther names\nHisbaal is the oldest name for <this city>. It appears to have originated during the Phoenician colonisation of the Tartessian culture in south-western Iberia and it refers to the god Baal. According to Manuel Pellicer Catal\u00e1n, the ancient name was Spal, and it meant \"lowland\" in the Phoenician language (cognate to the Hebrew Shfela and the Arabic Asfal \u0623\u0633\u0641\u0644). During Roman rule, the name was Latinised as Hispal and later as Hispalis. After the Umayyad invasion, this name remained in use among the Mozarabs, being adapted into Arabic as I\u0161b\u012bliya (\u0625\u0634\u0628\u064a\u0644\u064a\u0629): since the /p/ phoneme does not exist in Arabic, it was replaced by /b/; the Latin place-name suffix -is was Arabized as -iya, and a /\u00e6/ turned into \u012b /i\u02d0/ due to the phonetic phenomenon called im\u0101la.In the meantime, the city's official name had been changed to \u1e24im\u1e63 al-Andalus (\u062d\u0645\u0635 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0646\u062f\u0644\u0633), in reference to the city of Homs in modern Syria, the jund of which <this city> had been assigned to upon the Umayyad conquest; \"\u1e24im\u1e63 al-Andalus\" remained a customary and affectionate name for the city during the whole period throughout the Muslim Arab world, being referred to for example in the encyclopedia of Yaqut al-Hamawi or in Abu al-Baqa ar-Rundi's Ritha' al-Andalus.The city is sometimes referred to as the \"Pearl of Andalusia\".\nThe inhabitants of the city are known as sevillanos (feminine form: sevillanas) or hispalenses, after the Roman name of the city.\n\nMotto\nNO8DO is the official motto of <this city>, popularly believed to be a rebus signifying the Spanish No me ha dejado, meaning \"She [<this city>] has not abandoned me\". The phrase, pronounced with synalepha as [no ma \u00f0e\u02c8xa\u00f0o] no-madeja-do, is written with an eight in the middle representing the word madeja [ma\u02c8\u00f0exa] \"skein [of wool]\". Legend states that the title was given by King Alfonso X, who was resident in the city's Alc\u00e1zar and supported by the citizens when his son, later Sancho IV of Castile, tried to usurp the throne from him.\nThe emblem is present on <this city>'s municipal flag, and features on city property such as manhole covers, and Christopher Columbus's tomb in the cathedral.\n\nHistory\n<this city> is approximately 2,200 years old. The passage of the various civilizations instrumental in its growth has left the city with a distinct personality, and a large and well-preserved historical centre.\n\nEarly periods\nThe mythological founder of the city is Hercules (Heracles), commonly identified with the Phoenician god Melqart, who the myth says sailed through the Strait of Gibraltar to the Atlantic, and founded trading posts at the current sites of C\u00e1diz and of <this city>. The original core of the city, in the neighbourhood of the present-day street, Cuesta del Rosario, dates to the 8th century BC, when <this city> was on an island in the Guadalquivir. Archaeological excavations in 1999 found anthropic remains under the north wall of the Real Alc\u00e1zar dating to the 8th\u20137th century BC. The town was called Hisbaal by the Phoenicians and by the Tartessians, the indigenous pre-Roman Iberian people of Tartessos, who controlled the Guadalquivir Valley at the time.\nThe city was known from Roman times as Hispal and later as Hispalis. Hispalis developed into one of the great market and industrial centres of Hispania, while the nearby Roman city of Italica (present-day Santiponce, birthplace of the Roman emperors Trajan and Hadrian) remained a typically Roman residential city. Large-scale Roman archaeological remains can be seen there and at the nearby town of Carmona as well.\nExisting Roman features in <this city> itself include the remains exposed in situ in the underground Antiquarium of the Metropol Parasol building, the remnants of an aqueduct, three pillars of a temple in M\u00e1rmoles Street, the columns of La Alameda de H\u00e9rcules and the remains in the Patio de Banderas square near the <this city> Cathedral. The walls surrounding the city were originally built during the rule of Julius Caesar, but their current course and design were the result of Moorish reconstructions.Following Roman rule, there were successive conquests of the Roman province of Hispania Baetica by the Germanic Vandals, Suebi and Visigoths during the 5th and 6th centuries.\n\nMiddle Ages\nIn the wake of the Islamic conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, <this city> (Spalis) was seemingly taken by Musa ibn Nusayr in the late summer of 712, while he was on his way to M\u00e9rida. Yet it had to be retaken in July 713 by troops led by his son Abd al-Aziz ibn Musa, as the Visigothic population who had fled to Beja had returned to <this city> once Musa left for M\u00e9rida. The seat of the Wali of Al-Andalus (administrative division of the Umayyad Caliphate) was thus established in the city until 716, when the capital of Al-Andalus was relocated to C\u00f3rdoba.<this city> (Ishb\u012bliya) was sacked by Vikings in the mid-9th century. After Vikings arrived by 25 September 844, <this city> fell to invaders on 1 October, and they stood for 40 days before they fled from the city. During Umayyad rule, under an Andalusi-Arab framework, the bulk of the population were Muladi converts, to which Christian and Jewish minorities added up. Up until the arrival of the Almohads in the 12th century, the city remained as the see of a Metropolitan Archbishop, the leading Christian religious figure in al-Andalus. However, the transfer of the relics of Saint Isidore to Le\u00f3n circa 1063, in the taifa period, already hinted at a possible worsening of the situation of the local Christian minority.A powerful taifa kingdom with capital in <this city> emerged after 1023, in the wake of the fitna of al-Andalus. Ruled by the Abbadid dynasty, the taifa grew by aggregation of smaller neighbouring taifas. During the taifa period, <this city> became an important scholarly and literary centre. After several months of siege, <this city> was conquered by the Almoravids in 1091.\nThe city fell to the Almohads on 17 January 1147 (12 Sha\u02bdban 541). After an informal Almohad settlement in <this city> during the early stages of the Almohad presence in the Iberian Peninsula and then a brief relocation of the capital of al-Andalus to C\u00f3rdoba in 1162 (which had dire consequences for <this city>, reportedly depopulated and under starvation), <this city> became the definitive seat of the Andalusi part of the Almohad Empire in 1163, a twin capital alongside Marrakesh. Almohads carried out a large urban renewal. By the end of the 12th century, the walled enclosure perhaps contained 80,000 inhabitants.In the wider context of the Castilian\u2013Leonese conquest of the Guadalquivir Valley that ensued in the 13th century, Ferdinand III laid siege on <this city> in 1247. A naval blockade came to prevent relief of the city. The city surrendered on 23 November 1248, after fifteen months of siege. The conditions of capitulation contemplated the eviction of the population, with contemporary sources seemingly confirming that a mass movement of people out of <this city> indeed took place.The city's development continued after the Castilian conquest in 1248. Public buildings were constructed including churches\u2014many of which were built in the Mud\u00e9jar and Gothic styles\u2014such as the <this city> Cathedral, built during the 15th century with Gothic architecture. Other Moorish buildings were converted into Catholic edifices, as was customary of the Catholic Church during the Reconquista. The Moors' Palace became the Castilian royal residence, and during Pedro I's rule it was replaced by the Alc\u00e1zar (the upper levels are still used by the Spanish royal family as the official <this city> residence).\n\nAfter the 1391 pogrom, believed to having been instigated by the Archdeacon Ferrant Mart\u00ednez, all the synagogues in <this city> were converted to churches (renamed Santa Mar\u00eda la Blanca, San Bartolom\u00e9, Santa Cruz, and Convento Madre de Dios). The Jewish quarter's land and shops (which were located in modern-day Santa Cruz neighbourhood) were appropriated by the church. Many Jews were killed during the pogrom, although most were forced to convert.\nThe first tribunal of the Spanish Inquisition was instituted in <this city> in 1478. Its primary charge was to ensure that all nominal Christians were really behaving like Christians, and not practicing what Judaism they could in secret. At first, the activity of the Inquisition was limited to the dioceses of <this city> and C\u00f3rdoba, where the Dominican friar, Alonso de Ojeda, had detected converso activity. The first Auto de F\u00e9 took place in <this city> on 6 February 1481, when six people were burned alive. Alonso de Ojeda himself gave the sermon. The Inquisition then grew rapidly. The Plaza de San Francisco was the site of the 'autos de f\u00e9'. By 1492, tribunals existed in eight Castilian cities: \u00c1vila, C\u00f3rdoba, Ja\u00e9n, Medina del Campo, Segovia, Sig\u00fcenza, Toledo, and Valladolid; and by the Alhambra Decree all Jews were forced to convert to Catholicism or be exiled (expelled) from <this country>.\n\nEarly modern period\nFollowing the Columbian exploration of the New World, <this city> was chosen as headquarters of the Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n in 1503, which was the decisive development for <this city> becoming the port and gateway to the Indies. Unlike other harbours, reaching the port of <this city> required sailing about 80 kilometres (50 mi) up the River Guadalquivir. The choice of <this city> was made in spite of the difficulties for navigation in the Guadalquivir stemming from the increasing tonnage of ships as a result of the relentless drive to make maritime transport cheaper during the late Middle Ages. Nevertheless, technical suitability issues notwithstanding, the choice was still reasonable in the sense that <this city> had become the largest demographic, economic and financial centre of Christian Andalusia in the late Middle Ages.A 'golden age of development' commenced in <this city>, due to its being the only port awarded the royal monopoly for trade with the growing Spanish colonies in the Americas and the influx of riches from them.\nSince only sailing ships leaving from and returning to the inland port of <this city> could engage in trade with the Spanish Americas, merchants from Europe and other trade centres needed to go to <this city> to acquire New World trade goods. The city's population grew to more than a hundred thousand people.\nIn the late 16th century the monopoly was broken, with the port of C\u00e1diz also authorised as a port of trade. Throughout the 17th century, colonial trade declined. <this country>'s American Colonies improved their production of basic goods, reducing their need to import. Compounded with these tribulations was the silting of the Guadalquivir river in the 1620s, which made <this city>'s harbors harder to use, and ceased upriver shipping. The Great Plague of <this city> in 1649, exacerbated by excessive flooding of the Guadalquivir, reduced the population by almost half, and it would not recover until the early 19th century. By the 18th century, <this city>'s international importance was in decline. After the silting up of the harbour by the River Guadalquivir, upriver shipping ceased and the city went into relative economic decline.The writer Miguel de Cervantes lived primarily in <this city> between 1596 and 1600. Because of financial problems, Cervantes worked as a purveyor for the Spanish Armada, and later as a tax collector. In 1597, discrepancies in his accounts of the three years previous landed him in the Royal Prison of <this city> for a short time. His short story Rinconete y Cortadillo, since the 19th century one of his most-read pieces, includes much description of Sevillian society; it features two young vagabonds who come to <this city>, attracted by the riches and disorder that the 16th-century commerce with the Americas had brought to the city.\n\nDuring the 18th century Charles III of <this country> promoted <this city>'s industries. Construction of the Real F\u00e1brica de Tabacos (Royal Tobacco Factory) began in 1728. It was the second-largest building in <this country>, after the royal residence El Escorial. Since the 1950s it has been the seat of the rectorate (administration) of the University of <this city>, as well as its Schools of Law, Philology (language/letters), Geography, and History.More operas have been set in <this city> than in any other city of Europe. In 2012, a study of experts concluded the total number of operas set in <this city> is 153. Among the composers who fell in love with the city are Beethoven (Fidelio), Mozart (The Marriage of Figaro and Don Giovanni), Rossini (The Barber of <this city>), Donizetti (La favorite), and Bizet (Carmen).The first newspaper in <this country> outside of Madrid was <this city>'s Hebdomario \u00fatil de <this city>, which began publication in 1758.\n\nLate modern history\nBetween 1825 and 1833, Melchor Cano acted as chief architect in <this city>; most of the urban planning policy and architectural modifications of the city were made by him and his collaborator Jose Manuel Arjona y Cuba.Industrial architecture surviving today from the first half of the 19th century includes the ceramics factory installed in the Carthusian monastery at La Cartuja in 1841 by the Pickman family, and now home to the El Centro Andaluz de Arte Contempor\u00e1neo (CAAC), which manages the collections of the Museo de Arte Contempor\u00e1neo de Sevilla. It also houses the rectory of the UNIA.In the years that Queen Isabel II ruled directly, about 1843\u20131868, the Sevillian bourgeoisie invested in a construction boom unmatched in the city's history. The Isabel II bridge, better known as the Triana bridge, dates from this period; street lighting was expanded in the municipality and most of the streets were paved during this time as well.By the second half of the 19th century, <this city> had begun an expansion supported by railway construction and the demolition of part of its ancient walls, allowing the urban space of the city to grow eastward and southward. The Sevillana de Electricidad Company was created in 1894 to provide electric power throughout the municipality, and in 1901 the Plaza de Armas railway station was inaugurated.\n\nThe Museum of Fine Arts (Museo de Bellas Artes de Sevilla) opened in 1904.\nIn 1929 the city hosted the Ibero-American Exposition, which accelerated the southern expansion of the city and created new public spaces such as the Parque de Mar\u00eda Luisa (Maria Luisa Park) and the adjoining Plaza de Espa\u00f1a. Not long before the opening, the Spanish government began a modernisation of the city in order to prepare for the expected crowds by erecting new hotels and widening the mediaeval streets to allow for the movement of automobiles.\n<this city> fell very quickly at the beginning of the Spanish Civil War in 1936. General Queipo de Llano carried out a coup within the city, quickly capturing the city centre. Radio <this city> opposed the uprising and called for the peasants to come to the city for arms, while workers' groups established barricades. Queipo then moved to capture Radio <this city>, which he used to broadcast propaganda on behalf of the Francoist forces. After the initial takeover of the city, resistance continued among residents of the working-class neighbourhoods for some time, until a series of fierce reprisals took place.Under Francisco Franco's rule <this country> was officially neutral in World War II (although it did collaborate with the Axis powers), and like the rest of the country, <this city> remained largely economically and culturally isolated from the outside world. In 1953 the shipyard of <this city> was opened, eventually employing more than 2,000 workers in the 1970s. Before the existence of wetlands regulation in the Guadalquivir basin, <this city> suffered regular heavy flooding; perhaps worst of all were the floods that occurred in November 1961 when the River Tamarguillo, a tributary of the Guadalquivir, overflowed as a result of a prodigious downpour of rain, and <this city> was consequently declared a disaster zone.Trade unionism in <this city> began during the 1960s with the underground organisational activities of the Workers' Commissions or Comisiones Obreras (CCOO), in factories such as Hytasa, the Astilleros shipyards, Hispano Aviaci\u00f3n, etc. Several of the movement's leaders were imprisoned in November 1973.\n\nRecent developments\nOn 3 April 1979 <this country> held its first democratic municipal elections after the end of Franco's dictatorship; councillors representing four different political parties were elected in <this city>. On 5 November 1982, Pope John Paul II arrived in <this city> to officiate at a Mass before more than half a million people at the fairgrounds. He visited the city again on 13 June 1993, for the International Eucharistic Congress.\n\nIn 1992, coinciding with the fifth centenary of the Discovery of the Americas, the Universal Exposition was held for six months in <this city>, on the occasion of which the local communications network and urban infrastructure was greatly improved under a 1987 PGOU plan launched by Mayor Manuel del Valle: the SE-30 ring road around the city was completed and new highways were constructed; the new <this city>-Santa Justa railway station had opened in 1991, while the Spanish High-Speed Rail system, the Alta Velocidad Espa\u00f1ola (AVE), began to operate between Madrid-<this city>. The <this city> Airport was expanded with a new terminal building designed by the architect Rafael Moneo, and various other improvements were made. The Alamillo Bridge and the Centenario Bridge, both crossing over the Guadalquivir, also were built for the occasion. Some of the installations remaining at the site after the exposition were converted into the Scientific and Technological Park Cartuja 93.\nIn 2004 the Metropol Parasol project, commonly known as Las Setas ('The Mushrooms'), due to the appearance of the structure, was launched to revitalise the Plaza de la Encarnaci\u00f3n, for years used as a car park and seen as a dead spot between more popular tourist destinations in the city. The Metropol Parasol was completed in March 2011, costing just over \u20ac102 million in total, more than twice as much as originally planned. Constructed from crossed wooden beams, Las Setas is said to be the largest timber-framed structure in the world.\n\nGeography and climate\nLocation\n<this city> has an area of 141 km2 (54 sq mi), according to the National Topographic Map (Mapa Topogr\u00e1fico Nacional) series from the Instituto Geogr\u00e1fico Nacional \u2013 Centro Nacional de Informaci\u00f3n Geogr\u00e1fica, the country's civilian survey organisation (pages 984, 985 and 1002). The city is situated in the fertile valley of the River Guadalquivir. The average height above sea level is 7 metres (23 feet). Most of the city is on the east side of the river, while Triana, La Cartuja and Los Remedios are on the west side. The Aljarafe region lies further west, and is considered part of the metropolitan area. The city has boundaries on the north with La Rinconada, La Algaba and Santiponce; on the east with Alcal\u00e1 de Guadaira; on the south with Dos Hermanas and Gelves and on the west with San Juan de Aznalfarache, Tomares and Camas.\n<this city> is on the same parallel as United States west coast city San Jose in central California. S\u00e3o Miguel, the main island of the Azores archipelago, lies on the same latitude. Further east from <this city> in the Mediterranean Basin, it is on the same latitude as Catania in Sicily, Italy and just south of Athens, the capital of Greece. Beyond that, it is located on the same parallel as South Korean capital, Seoul. <this city> is located inland, not very far from the Andalusian coast, but still sees a much more continental climate than the nearest port cities, C\u00e1diz and Huelva. Its distance from the sea makes summers in Sevilla much hotter than along the coastline.\n\nClimate\n<this city> has a Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Csa), featuring very hot, dry summers and mild winters with moderate rainfall. <this city> has an annual average of 19.2 \u00b0C (67 \u00b0F). The annual average temperature is 25.4 \u00b0C (78 \u00b0F) during the day and 13.0 \u00b0C (55 \u00b0F) at night. <this city> is located in the lower part of the Guadalquivir Valley, which is often referred to as \"the frying pan of Andalucia\", as it features the hottest cities in the country.<this city> is the warmest city in Continental Europe. It is also the hottest major metropolitan area in Europe, with summer average high temperatures of above 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F) and also the hottest in <this country>. After the city of C\u00f3rdoba (also in Andalusia), <this city> has the hottest summer in continental Europe among all cities with a population over 100,000 people, with average daily highs of 36.0 \u00b0C (97 \u00b0F) in July.Temperatures above 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F) are not uncommon in summer. The hottest temperature extreme of 46.6 \u00b0C (116 \u00b0F) was registered by the weather station at <this city> Airport on 23 July 1995 while the coldest temperature extreme of \u22125.5 \u00b0C (22 \u00b0F) was also registered by the airport weather station on 12 February 1956. A historical record high (disputed) of 50.0 \u00b0C (122 \u00b0F) was recorded on 4 August 1881, according to the NOAA Satellite and Information Service. There is an unaccredited record by the National Institute of Meteorology of 47.2 \u00b0C (117 \u00b0F) on 1 August during the 2003 heat wave, according to a weather station (83910 LEZL) located in the southern part of <this city> Airport, near the former US San Pablo Air Force Base. This temperature would be one of the highest ever recorded in <this country>, yet it hasn't been officially confirmed.The average sunshine hours in <this city> are approximately 3000 per year. Snowfall is virtually unknown, and the last important snowfall occurred in 1954. Since the year 1500, only 10 snowfalls have been recorded/reported in <this city>. During the 20th century, <this city> registered just 2 snowfalls, the last one on 2 February 1954.\nWinters are mild: December and January are the coolest months, with average maximum temperatures around 16 to 17 \u00b0C (61 to 63 \u00b0F) and minimums of 6 to 7 \u00b0C (43 to 45 \u00b0F).\nSummers are very hot: July and August are the hottest months, with average maximum temperatures around 35 to 36 \u00b0C (95 to 97 \u00b0F) and minimums of 20 to 21 \u00b0C (68 to 70 \u00b0F).\nPrecipitation varies from 500 to 600 mm (19.7 to 23.6 in) and there are around 50 rainy days per year, with frequent torrential rain. December is the wettest month, with an average rainfall of 99 millimetres (3.9 in).\n\nGovernment\nMunicipal government and administration\n<this city> is a municipality, the basic level of local government in <this country>. The Ayuntamiento is the body charged with the municipal government and administration. The Plenary of the ayuntamiento is formed by 31 elected municipal councillors, who in turn invest the mayor. The last municipal election took place on 26 May 2019. The current mayor is Antonio Mu\u00f1oz (Spanish Socialist Workers' Party), who has held the post since the reign of the previous mayor, Juan Espadas in early 2022.\n\nRegional and provincial capital\n<this city> is the capital of the autonomous community of Andalusia, according to Article 4 of the Statute of Autonomy of Andalusia of 2007, and is the capital of the Province of <this city> as well. The historical building of the Palace of San Telmo is now the seat of the presidency of the Andalusian Autonomous Government. The administrative headquarters are in Torre Triana, in La Cartuja. The Hospital de las Cinco Llagas (literally, \"Hospital of the Five Holy Wounds\") is the current seat of the Parliament of Andalusia.\n\nDistricts and neighbourhoods\nThe municipal administration is decentralized into 11 districts, further divided into 108 neighbourhoods.\n\nMain sights\n<this city> is a big tourist centre in <this country>. In 2018, there were over 2.5 million travellers and tourists who stayed at a tourist accommodation, placing it third in <this country> after Madrid and Barcelona. The city has an overall low level of seasonality, so there are tourists year-round. There are many landmarks, museums, parks, gardens and other kinds of tourist spots around the city so there is something for everyone. The Alc\u00e1zar, the Cathedral, and the General Archive of the Indies are UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\nMany of the city's most important sights and monuments are located in the historic centre (Casco Antiguo). To the north of the centre is the Macarena neighbourhood, which contains some important monuments and religious buildings, such as the Museum and Catholic Church of La Macarena or the Hospital de las Cinco Llagas. Across the river, on the west bank of the Guadalquivir, the neighbourhood of Triana had an important role in the history of the city.\n\nChurches\nThe <this city> Cathedral, officially the Cathedral of Saint Mary of the See, is considered the largest Gothic cathedral in the world and one of the largest cathedrals in the world. Incorporating parts of the city's former main mosque that was built under the Almohads in the 12th century, the current building is a massive Gothic structure begun after 1401 and finished in 1506, with additional reconstruction occurring between 1511 and 1519. The church contains a number of important tombs, including one of the two claimed burial places of Christopher Columbus, as well as many important artworks, including the largest retable (altarpiece) in <this country>. A number of later additions, mostly in Plateresque or Renaissance style, were added around the outside of the Gothic structure after its initial construction.One of the city's most prominent landmarks is the cathedral's bell tower, the Giralda, formerly the minaret of the Almohad mosque. The minaret's main shaft is a little over 50 meters tall. The tower was further heightened in the 16th century by the addition of a large Renaissance-style belfry, which brings its total height to around 95 or 96 meters. The top of the tower is crowned by the Giraldillo, a cast bronze weather vane sculpture, from which the name \"Giralda\" is derived.The Church of San Salvador, located at Plaza de San Salvador, is the second largest church in the city after the cathedral. Originally converted from the city's oldest mosque, it was rebuilt in Baroque form in the 17th century and was the city's only collegiate church. The Church of Saint Louis of France, built between 1699 and 1731 and designed by Leonardo de Figueroa, represents another example of Baroque architecture.\n\nPalaces and mansions\nTo the south of the cathedral, the Alc\u00e1zar is a sprawling palace and garden complex which served as the city's center of power. The site was occupied since ancient times but was located outside the Roman city walls. The current palace complex was founded in the 10th century as a governor's palace, then expanded in the 11th century when it became the palace of the Abbadid rulers. Some limited parts of the palace still date from its 12th-century expansion under Almohad rule, but most of the site was redeveloped after the Christian conquest of the city in the 13th century. A major construction campaign took place in the 1360s under Pedro I, who constructed a new palace in Mud\u00e9jar style, aided in part by craftsmen from Granada. Richly-decorated chambers and courtyards date from this period, such as the Patio de las Doncellas and the Sal\u00f3n de Embajadores. Further additions took place under the Catholic Monarchs in Renaissance style, which continued under the Habsburgs. The extensive gardens were also redesigned in this style and then further developed in the 17th century. The palace has been used as a filming location for various productions, including Game of Thrones.The Archbishop's Palace stands over the site of the former Roman baths of the city. The property was originally donated by Ferdinand III to Bishop Don Remondo in 1251, but the current building was built in the second half of the 16th century, followed by later additions. Its Baroque doorway was completed in 1704 by Lorenzo Fern\u00e1ndes de Iglesias.A number of other houses and wealthy mansions have been preserved across the city since the 16th century. Among the most famous is the Casa de Pilatos ('House of Pilate'), an aristocratic mansion blending multiple architectural styles. The house, bought by the Enriquez de Ribera family in 1483, has a typical courtyard plan but mixes older Isabelline and Mud\u00e9jar decoration with later Renaissance elements. After Don Fadrique Enriquez de Ribera returned from a pilgrimage to Jerusalem in 1520, he commissioned a stone portal at the entrance of the family mansion. The portal became the starting point for the Via Crucis to the Cruz del Campo, and later writers claimed it was modeled on the doorway of the house of Pontius Pilate in the Holy Land, thus earning the house its current name.Other historic mansions include the Palace of the Countess of Lebrija, the Palacio de las Due\u00f1as, and the Casa de los Pinelos. The Casa del Rey Moro is considered the oldest in <this city>, with its origins dated to the 15th century.\n\nFortifications\nThe city walls of <this city> were first built in ancient times on the orders of Julius Caesar. After the Viking attack on the city in 844, the walls were rebuilt on the orders of Abd ar-Rahman II. They were expanded under the Almoravids in 1126 and in 1221 the Almohads added a moat and a second outer line of walls. Most of the walls were demolished after 1861 to reduce restrictions on urban development, but a significant portion of the northern walls can still be seen today.The Torre del Oro is an Almohad defensive tower dating to 1220\u20131221. The tower was integrated into the city's defensive system and protected the city's harbour, along with another tower across the river. Between the bases of the two towers a chain could be raised to block ships and prevent entry into the port.\n\nCivic buildings and other monuments\nThe City Hall (Ayuntamiento) was begun by architect Diego de Ria\u00f1o, who worked on it between 1527 and 1534 and designed the eastern fa\u00e7ade on Plaza de San Francisco, a highlight of the Plateresque style. He was succeeded by other architects, including Hernan Ruiz II after 1560, who added a double-arched loggia on the western fa\u00e7ade. The Royal Prison originally stood nearby, where Cervantes was imprisoned and where it is believed he was inspired to write Don Quixote. In 1840, the nearby Convent of San Francisco was demolished and replaced by the present-day Plaza Nueva in 1854. After this, the city hall's was partly remodeled by Demetrio de los R\u00edos and Balbino Marr\u00f3n. It was given a new western fa\u00e7ade in Neoclassical style, completed in 1867.The General Archive of the Indies (Archivo General de Indias), located between the Cathedral and the Alc\u00e1zar, is the repository of valuable archival documents relating to the Spanish Empire in the Americas and the Philippines up to 1760. The building itself was designed in a Spanish Renaissance style in 1572 by Juan de Herrera to house the merchants' guild. Construction began in the 1580s and was not finished until 1646. The building was converted into the new Archive of the Indies in 1785.\nThe Palacio de San Telmo was originally a naval college established in 1671. Between 1722 and 1735 the building was completed by Leonardo de Figueroa and his son Mat\u00edas, who designed its present-day fa\u00e7ade, one of the most important monuments of Baroque architecture in Andalucia. The building now serves as the seat for the Andalusian Autonomous Government.The Royal Tobacco Factory (Real F\u00e1brica de Tabacos), located near the Palacio de San Telmo, was built between 1728 and 1771. It was designed in a Baroque style by Sebastian van der Borcht. It replaced an earlier tobacco factory built in 1687, which in turn had replaced <this city>'s first tobacco factory, San Pedro, which opened in a former women's penitentiary in 1620. Upon completion, the new factory was the largest industrial building in the world and included its own chapel and its own prison, and operated under its own laws.The city's bullring, the Real Maestranza, was designed in 1761 by Vicente San Martin. Its Baroque fa\u00e7ade was completed in 1787 but the rest of the building was only completed in 1881. The venue can accommodate 14,000 spectators.The Metropol Parasol, in La Encarnaci\u00f3n square, is the world's largest wooden structure. A monumental umbrella-like building designed by the German architect J\u00fcrgen Mayer, finished in 2011. This modern architecture structure houses the central market and an underground archaeological complex. The terrace roof is a city viewpoint.\n\nParque de Mar\u00eda Luisa\nThe sprawling Parque de Mar\u00eda Luisa (Mar\u00eda Luisa Park) was designed by architect An\u00edbal Gonz\u00e1lez for the 1929 Ibero-American Exposition. The park includes two major plazas, the Plaza de Espa\u00f1a and the Plaza de Am\u00e9rica, and several monuments and museums. They include outstanding examples of regionalist Revival architecture, a mix of Neo-Mud\u00e9jar and Neo-Renaissance, lavishly ornamented with typical glazed tiles.At the park's north end, the semi-circular Plaza de Espa\u00f1a is marked by tall towers and a series of benches covered in painted tiles dedicated to each of the 48 provinces of <this country>. The location has been used in the filming of several movies.At the southern end of the park, the Plaza de Am\u00e9rica is flanked by three structures emulating different historical styles: the Royal Pavilion has Gothic features, the Mud\u00e9jar Pavilion has a Mud\u00e9jar style, and the Bellas Artes Pavilion has a Renaissance style. The two latter pavilions are each used as museums today.\n\nMuseums\nThe most important art collection of <this city> is the Museum of Fine Arts of <this city>.
