  "wiki_text": "<this city> (English: ; French pronunciation: \u200b[pa\u0281i] (listen)) is the capital and most populous city of <this country>, with an official estimated population of 2,102,650 residents as of 1 January 2023 in an area of more than 105 km2 (41 sq mi), making it the fourth-most populated city in the European Union as well as the  30th most densely populated city in the world in 2022. Since the 17th century, <this city> has been one of the world's major centres of finance, diplomacy, commerce, culture, fashion, gastronomy and many areas. For its leading role in the arts and sciences, as well as its early and extensive system of street lighting, in the 19th century, it became known as \"the City of Light\".The City of <this city> is the centre of the \u00cele-de-<this country> region, or <this city> Region, with an official estimated population of 12,271,794 inhabitants on January 1, 2023, or about 19% of the population of <this country>, making the region <this country>'s primate city. The <this city> Region had a GDP of \u20ac765 billion in 2021, the highest in the European Union. According to the Economist Intelligence Unit Worldwide Cost of Living Survey, in 2022, <this city> was the city with the ninth-highest cost of living in the world.<this city> is a major railway, highway, and air-transport hub served by two international airports: Charles de Gaulle Airport (the second-busiest airport in Europe) and Orly Airport. Opened in 1900, the city's subway system, the <this city> M\u00e9tro, serves 5.23 million passengers daily; it is the second-busiest metro system in Europe after the Moscow Metro. Gare du Nord is the 24th-busiest railway station in the world and the busiest outside Japan, with 262 million passengers in 2015. <this city> is especially known for its museums and architectural landmarks: the Louvre received 7.8 million visitors in 2022, keeping its position as the most-visited art museum in the world. The Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Mus\u00e9e Marmottan Monet and Mus\u00e9e de l'Orangerie are noted for their collections of French Impressionist art. The Pompidou Centre Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne has the largest collection of modern and contemporary art in Europe and Mus\u00e9e Rodin and Mus\u00e9e Picasso. The historical district along the Seine in the city centre has been classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1991.<this city> hosts several United Nations organizations including UNESCO, and other international organizations such as the OECD, the OECD Development Centre, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, the International Energy Agency, the International Federation for Human Rights, along with European bodies such as the European Space Agency, the European Banking Authority or the European Securities and Markets Authority. The football club <this city> Saint-Germain and the rugby union club Stade Fran\u00e7ais are based in <this city>. The 80,000-seat Stade de <this country>, built for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, is located just north of <this city> in the neighbouring commune of Saint-Denis. <this city> hosts the annual French Open Grand Slam tennis tournament on the red clay of Roland Garros. The city hosted the Olympic Games in 1900 and 1924, and will host the 2024 Summer Olympics. The 1938 and 1998 FIFA World Cups, the 2007 Rugby World Cup, as well as the 1960, 1984 and 2016 UEFA European Championships were also held in the city. Every July, the Tour de <this country> bicycle race finishes on the Avenue des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in <this city>.\n\nEtymology\nThe ancient oppidum that corresponds to the modern city of <this city> was first mentioned in the mid-1st century BC by Julius Caesar as Luteciam <this city>iorum ('Lutetia of the <this city>ii'), and is later attested as <this city>ion in the 5th century AD, then as <this city> in 1265. During the Roman period, it was commonly known as Lutetia or Lutecia in Latin, and as Leukotek\u00eda in Greek, which is interpreted as either stemming from the Celtic root *lukot- ('mouse'), or from *luto- ('marsh, swamp').The name <this city> is derived from its early inhabitants, the <this city>ii, a Gallic tribe from the Iron Age and the Roman period. The meaning of the Gaulish ethnonym remains debated. According to Xavier Delamarre, it may derive from the Celtic root pario- ('cauldron'). Alfred Holder interpreted the name as 'the makers' or 'the commanders', by comparing it to the Welsh peryff ('lord, commander'), both possibly descending from a Proto-Celtic form reconstructed as *kwar-is-io-. Alternatively, Pierre-Yves Lambert proposed to translate <this city>ii as the 'spear people', by connecting the first element to the Old Irish carr ('spear'), derived from an earlier *kwar-s\u0101. In any case, the city's name is not related to the <this city> of Greek mythology.\nInhabitants are known in English as \"<this city>ians\" and in French as <this city>iens ([pa\u0281izj\u025b\u0303] (listen)). They are also pejoratively called Parigots ([pa\u0281i\u0261o] (listen)).\n\nHistory\nOrigins\nThe <this city>ii, a sub-tribe of the Celtic Senones, inhabited the <this city> area from around the middle of the 3rd century BC. One of the area's major north\u2013south trade routes crossed the Seine on the \u00eele de la Cit\u00e9, which gradually became an important trading centre. The <this city>ii traded with many river towns (some as far away as the Iberian Peninsula) and minted their own coins.\nThe Romans conquered the <this city> Basin in 52 BC and began their settlement on <this city>'s Left Bank. The Roman town was originally called Lutetia (more fully, Lutetia <this city>iorum, \"Lutetia of the <this city>ii\", modern French Lut\u00e8ce). It became a prosperous city with a forum, baths, temples, theatres, and an amphitheatre.By the end of the Western Roman Empire, the town was known as <this city>ius, a Latin name that would later become <this city> in French. Christianity was introduced in the middle of the 3rd century AD by Saint Denis, the first Bishop of <this city>: according to legend, when he refused to renounce his faith before the Roman occupiers, he was beheaded on the hill which became known as Mons Martyrum (Latin \"Hill of Martyrs\"), later \"Montmartre\", from where he walked headless to the north of the city; the place where he fell and was buried became an important religious shrine, the Basilica of Saint-Denis, and many French kings are buried there.Clovis the Frank, the first king of the Merovingian dynasty, made the city his capital from 508. As the Frankish domination of Gaul began, there was a gradual immigration by the Franks to <this city> and the <this city>ian Francien dialects were born. Fortification of the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9 failed to avert sacking by Vikings in 845, but <this city>'s strategic importance\u2014with its bridges preventing ships from passing\u2014was established by successful defence in the Siege of <this city> (885\u2013886), for which the then Count of <this city> (comte de <this city>), Odo of <this country>, was elected king of West Francia. From the Capetian dynasty that began with the 987 election of Hugh Capet, Count of <this city> and Duke of the Franks (duc des Francs), as king of a unified West Francia, <this city> gradually became the largest and most prosperous city in <this country>.\n\nHigh and Late Middle Ages to Louis XIV\nBy the end of the 12th century, <this city> had become the political, economic, religious, and cultural capital of <this country>. The Palais de la Cit\u00e9, the royal residence, was located at the western end of the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9. In 1163, during the reign of Louis VII, Maurice de Sully, bishop of <this city>, undertook the construction of the Notre Dame Cathedral at its eastern extremity.\nAfter the marshland between the river Seine and its slower 'dead arm' to its north was filled in from around the 10th century, <this city>'s cultural centre began to move to the Right Bank. In 1137, a new city marketplace (today's Les Halles) replaced the two smaller ones on the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9 and Place de Gr\u00e8ve (Place de l'H\u00f4tel de Ville). The latter location housed the headquarters of <this city>'s river trade corporation, an organisation that later became, unofficially (although formally in later years), <this city>'s first municipal government.\nIn the late 12th century, Philip Augustus extended the Louvre fortress to defend the city against river invasions from the west, gave the city its first walls between 1190 and 1215, rebuilt its bridges to either side of its central island, and paved its main thoroughfares. In 1190, he transformed <this city>'s former cathedral school into a student-teacher corporation that would become the University of <this city> and would draw students from all of Europe.With 200,000 inhabitants in 1328, <this city>, then already the capital of <this country>, was the most populous city of Europe. By comparison, London in 1300 had 80,000 inhabitants. By the early fourteenth century, so much filth had collected inside urban Europe that French and Italian cities were naming streets after human waste. In medieval <this city>, several street names were inspired by merde, the French word for \"shit\".\nDuring the Hundred Years' War, <this city> was occupied by England-friendly Burgundian forces from 1418, before being occupied outright by the English when Henry V of England entered the French capital in 1420; in spite of a 1429 effort by Joan of Arc to liberate the city, it would remain under English occupation until 1436.\nIn the late 16th-century French Wars of Religion, <this city> was a stronghold of the Catholic League, the organisers of 24 August 1572 St. Bartholomew's Day massacre in which thousands of French Protestants were killed. The conflicts ended when pretender to the throne Henry IV, after converting to Catholicism to gain entry to the capital, entered the city in 1594 to claim the crown of <this country>. This king made several improvements to the capital during his reign: he completed the construction of <this city>'s first uncovered, sidewalk-lined bridge, the Pont Neuf, built a Louvre extension connecting it to the Tuileries Palace, and created the first <this city> residential square, the Place Royale, now Place des Vosges. In spite of Henry IV's efforts to improve city circulation, the narrowness of <this city>'s streets was a contributing factor in his assassination near Les Halles marketplace in 1610.During the 17th century, Cardinal Richelieu, chief minister of Louis XIII, was determined to make <this city> the most beautiful city in Europe. He built five new bridges, a new chapel for the College of Sorbonne, and a palace for himself, the Palais-Cardinal. After Richelieu's death in 1642, it was renamed the Palais-Royal.\nDue to the <this city>ian uprisings during the Fronde civil war, Louis XIV moved his court to a new palace, Versailles, in 1682. Although no longer the capital of <this country>, arts and sciences in the city flourished with the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise, the Academy of Painting, and the French Academy of Sciences. To demonstrate that the city was safe from attack, the king had the city walls demolished and replaced with tree-lined boulevards that would become the Grands Boulevards. Other marks of his reign were the Coll\u00e8ge des Quatre-Nations, the Place Vend\u00f4me, the Place des Victoires, and Les Invalides.\n\n18th and 19th centuries\n<this city> grew in population from about 400,000 in 1640 to 650,000 in 1780. A new boulevard, the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, extended the city west to \u00c9toile, while the working-class neighbourhood of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine on the eastern side of the city grew more and more crowded with poor migrant workers from other regions of <this country>.\n<this city> was the centre of an explosion of philosophic and scientific activity known as the Age of Enlightenment. Diderot and d'Alembert published their Encyclop\u00e9die in 1751, and the Montgolfier Brothers launched the first manned flight in a hot-air balloon on 21 November 1783. <this city> was the financial capital of continental Europe, the primary European centre of book publishing and fashion and the manufacture of fine furniture and luxury goods.In the summer of 1789, <this city> became the centre stage of the French Revolution. On 14 July, a mob seized the arsenal at the Invalides, acquiring thousands of guns, and stormed the Bastille, a symbol of royal authority. The first independent <this city> Commune, or city council, met in the H\u00f4tel de Ville and, on 15 July, elected a Mayor, the astronomer Jean Sylvain Bailly.Louis XVI and the royal family were brought to <this city> and made prisoners in the Tuileries Palace. In 1793, as the revolution turned more and more radical, the king, queen, and mayor were guillotined (executed) in the Reign of Terror, along with more than 16,000 others throughout <this country>. The property of the aristocracy and the church was nationalised, and the city's churches were closed, sold or demolished. A succession of revolutionary factions ruled <this city> until 9 November 1799 (coup d'\u00e9tat du 18 brumaire), when Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte seized power as First Consul.The population of <this city> had dropped by 100,000 during the Revolution, but between 1799 and 1815, it surged with 160,000 new residents, reaching 660,000. Napoleon Bonaparte replaced the elected government of <this city> with a prefect reporting only to him. He began erecting monuments to military glory, including the Arc de Triomphe, and improved the neglected infrastructure of the city with new fountains, the Canal de l'Ourcq, P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery and the city's first metal bridge, the Pont des Arts.\nDuring the Restoration, the bridges and squares of <this city> were returned to their pre-Revolution names; the July Revolution in 1830 (commemorated by the July Column on the Place de la Bastille) brought a constitutional monarch, Louis Philippe I, to power. The first railway line to <this city> opened in 1837, beginning a new period of massive migration from the provinces to the city. Louis-Philippe was overthrown by a popular uprising in the streets of <this city> in 1848. His successor, Napoleon III, alongside the newly appointed prefect of the Seine, Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann, launched a gigantic public works project to build wide new boulevards, a new opera house, a central market, new aqueducts, sewers and parks, including the Bois de Boulogne and Bois de Vincennes. In 1860, Napoleon III also annexed the surrounding towns and created eight new arrondissements, expanding <this city> to its current limits.During the Franco-Prussian War (1870\u20131871), <this city> was besieged by the Prussian Army. After months of blockade, hunger, and then bombardment by the Prussians, the city was forced to surrender on 28 January 1871. On 28 March, a revolutionary government called the <this city> Commune seized power in <this city>. The Commune held power for two months, until it was harshly suppressed by the French army during the \"Bloody Week\" at the end of May 1871.Late in the 19th century, <this city> hosted two major international expositions: the 1889 Universal Exposition, was held to mark the centennial of the French Revolution and featured the new Eiffel Tower; and the 1900 Universal Exposition, which gave <this city> the Pont Alexandre III, the Grand Palais, the Petit Palais and the first <this city> M\u00e9tro line. <this city> became the laboratory of Naturalism (\u00c9mile Zola) and Symbolism (Charles Baudelaire and Paul Verlaine), and of Impressionism in art (Courbet, Manet, Monet, Renoir).\n\n20th and 21st centuries\nBy 1901, the population of <this city> had grown to about 2,715,000. At the beginning of the century, artists from around the world including Pablo Picasso, Modigliani, and Henri Matisse made <this city> their home. It was the birthplace of Fauvism, Cubism and abstract art, and authors such as Marcel Proust were exploring new approaches to literature.During the First World War, <this city> sometimes found itself on the front line; 600 to 1,000 <this city> taxis played a small but highly important symbolic role in transporting 6,000 soldiers to the front line at the First Battle of the Marne. The city was also bombed by Zeppelins and shelled by German long-range guns. In the years after the war, known as Les Ann\u00e9es Folles, <this city> continued to be a mecca for writers, musicians and artists from around the world, including Ernest Hemingway, Igor Stravinsky, James Joyce, Josephine Baker, Eva Kotchever, Henry Miller, Ana\u00efs Nin, Sidney Bechet and Salvador Dal\u00ed.In the years after the peace conference, the city was also home to growing numbers of students and activists from French colonies and other Asian and African countries, who later became leaders of their countries, such as Ho Chi Minh, Zhou Enlai and L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor.\nOn 14 June 1940, the German army marched into <this city>, which had been declared an \"open city\". On 16\u201317 July 1942, following German orders, the French police and gendarmes arrested 12,884 Jews, including 4,115 children, and confined them during five days at the Vel d'Hiv (V\u00e9lodrome d'Hiver), from which they were transported by train to the extermination camp at Auschwitz. None of the children came back. On 25 August 1944, the city was liberated by the French 2nd Armoured Division and the 4th Infantry Division of the United States Army. General Charles de Gaulle led a huge and emotional crowd down the Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es towards Notre Dame de <this city>, and made a rousing speech from the H\u00f4tel de Ville.In the 1950s and the 1960s, <this city> became one front of the Algerian War for independence; in August 1961, the pro-independence FLN targeted and killed 11 <this city> policemen, leading to the imposition of a curfew on Muslims of Algeria (who, at that time, were French citizens). On 17 October 1961, an unauthorised but peaceful protest demonstration of Algerians against the curfew led to violent confrontations between the police and demonstrators, in which at least 40 people were killed. The anti-independence Organisation arm\u00e9e secr\u00e8te (OAS) carried out a series of bombings in <this city> throughout 1961 and 1962.In May 1968, protesting students occupied the Sorbonne and put up barricades in the Latin Quarter. Thousands of <this city>ian blue-collar workers joined the students, and the movement grew into a two-week general strike. Supporters of the government won the June elections by a large majority. The May 1968 events in <this country> resulted in the break-up of the University of <this city> into 13 independent campuses. In 1975, the National Assembly changed the status of <this city> to that of other French cities and, on 25 March 1977, Jacques Chirac became the first elected mayor of <this city> since 1793. The Tour Maine-Montparnasse, the tallest building in the city at 57 storeys and 210 m (689 ft) high, was built between 1969 and 1973. It was highly controversial, and it remains the only building in the centre of the city over 32 storeys high. The population of <this city> dropped from 2,850,000 in 1954 to 2,152,000 in 1990, as middle-class families moved to the suburbs. A suburban railway network, the RER (R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional), was built to complement the M\u00e9tro; the P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique expressway encircling the city, was completed in 1973.Most of the postwar presidents of the Fifth Republic wanted to leave their own monuments in <this city>; President Georges Pompidou started the Centre Georges Pompidou (1977), Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing began the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay (1986); President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand had the Op\u00e9ra Bastille built (1985\u20131989), the new site of the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de <this country> (1996), the Arche de la D\u00e9fense (1985\u20131989) in La D\u00e9fense, as well as the Louvre Pyramid with its underground courtyard (1983\u20131989); Jacques Chirac (2006), the Mus\u00e9e du quai Branly.In the early 21st century, the population of <this city> began to increase slowly again, as more young people moved into the city. It reached 2.25 million in 2011. In March 2001, Bertrand Delano\u00eb became the first socialist mayor. In 2007, in an effort to reduce car traffic, he introduced the V\u00e9lib', a system which rents bicycles. Bertrand Delano\u00eb also transformed a section of the highway along the Left Bank of the Seine into an urban promenade and park, the Promenade des Berges de la Seine, which he inaugurated in June 2013.\nIn 2007, President Nicolas Sarkozy launched the Grand <this city> project, to integrate <this city> more closely with the towns in the region around it. After many modifications, the new area, named the Metropolis of Grand <this city>, with a population of 6.7 million, was created on 1 January 2016. In 2011, the City of <this city> and the national government approved the plans for the Grand <this city> Express, totalling 205 km (127 mi) of automated metro lines to connect <this city>, the innermost three departments around <this city>, airports and high-speed rail (TGV) stations, at an estimated cost of \u20ac35 billion. The system is scheduled to be completed by 2030.In January 2015, Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claimed attacks across the <this city> region. 1.5 million people marched in <this city> in a show of solidarity against terrorism and in support of freedom of speech. In November of the same year, terrorist attacks, claimed by ISIL, killed 130 people and injured more than 350.On 22 April 2016, the <this city> Agreement was signed by 196 nations of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in an aim to limit the effects of climate change below 2\u00b0C.\n\nGeography\nLocation\n<this city> is located in northern central <this country>, in a north-bending arc of the river Seine whose crest includes two islands, the \u00cele Saint-Louis and the larger \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9, which form the oldest part of the city. The river's mouth on the English Channel (La Manche) is about 233 mi (375 km) downstream from the city. The city is spread widely on both banks of the river. Overall, the city is relatively flat, and the lowest point is 35 m (115 ft) above sea level. <this city> has several prominent hills, the highest of which is Montmartre at 130 m (427 ft).Excluding the outlying parks of Bois de Boulogne and Bois de Vincennes, <this city> covers an oval measuring about 87 km2 (34 sq mi) in area, enclosed by the 35 km (22 mi) ring road, the Boulevard P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique. The city's last major annexation of outlying territories in 1860 not only gave it its modern form but also created the 20 clockwise-spiralling arrondissements (municipal boroughs). From the 1860 area of 78 km2 (30 sq mi), the city limits were expanded marginally to 86.9 km2 (33.6 sq mi) in the 1920s. In 1929, the Bois de Boulogne and Bois de Vincennes forest parks were officially annexed to the city, bringing its area to about 105 km2 (41 sq mi). The metropolitan area is 2,300 km2 (890 sq mi).Measured from the 'point zero' in front of its Notre-Dame cathedral, <this city> by road is 450 km (280 mi) southeast of London, 287 km (178 mi) south of Calais, 305 km (190 mi) southwest of Brussels, 774 km (481 mi) north of Marseille, 385 km (239 mi) northeast of Nantes, and 135 km (84 mi) southeast of Rouen.\n\nClimate\n<this city> has a typical Western European oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb), which is affected by the North Atlantic Current. The overall climate throughout the year is mild and moderately wet. Summer days are usually warm and pleasant with average temperatures between 15 and 25 \u00b0C (59 and 77 \u00b0F), and a fair amount of sunshine. Each year, however, there are a few days when the temperature rises above 32 \u00b0C (90 \u00b0F). Longer periods of more intense heat sometimes occur, such as the heat wave of 2003 when temperatures exceeded 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) for weeks, reached 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F) on some days and rarely cooled down at night. Spring and autumn have, on average, mild days and fresh nights but are changing and unstable. Surprisingly warm or cool weather occurs frequently in both seasons. In winter, sunshine is scarce; days are cool, and nights are cold but generally above freezing with low temperatures around 3 \u00b0C (37 \u00b0F). Light night frosts are however quite common, but the temperature seldom dips below \u22125 \u00b0C (23 \u00b0F). The city sometimes sees light snow or flurries with or without accumulation.<this city> has an average annual precipitation of 641 mm (25.2 in), and experiences light rainfall distributed evenly throughout the year. However, the city is known for intermittent, abrupt, heavy showers. The highest recorded temperature was 42.6 \u00b0C (108.7 \u00b0F) on 25 July 2019, and the lowest was \u221223.9 \u00b0C (\u221211.0 \u00b0F) on 10 December 1879.\n\nAdministration\nCity government\nFor almost all of its long history, except for a few brief periods, <this city> was governed directly by representatives of the king, emperor, or president of <this country>. The city was not granted municipal autonomy by the National Assembly until 1974. The first modern elected mayor of <this city> was Jacques Chirac, elected 20 March 1977, becoming the city's first mayor since 1871 and only the fourth since 1794. The current mayor is Anne Hidalgo, a socialist, first elected 5 April 2014 and re-elected 28 June 2020.\nThe mayor of <this city> is elected indirectly by <this city> voters; the voters of each of the city's 20 arrondissements elect members to the Conseil de <this city> (Council of <this city>), which subsequently elects the mayor. The council is composed of 163 members, with each arrondissement allocated a number of seats dependent upon its population, from 10 members for each of the least-populated arrondissements to 34 members for the most populated. The council is elected using closed list proportional representation in a two-round system. Party lists winning an absolute majority in the first round \u2013 or at least a plurality in the second round \u2013 automatically win half the seats of an arrondissement. The remaining half of seats are distributed proportionally to all lists which win at least 5% of the vote using the highest averages method. This ensures that the winning party or coalition always wins a majority of the seats, even if they do not win an absolute majority of the vote.Each of <this city>'s 20 arrondissements has its own town hall and a directly elected council (conseil d'arrondissement), which, in turn, elects an arrondissement mayor. The council of each arrondissement is composed of members of the Conseil de <this city> and also members who serve only on the council of the arrondissement. The number of deputy mayors in each arrondissement varies depending upon its population. There are a total of 20 arrondissement mayors and 120 deputy mayors.\n\nM\u00e9tropole du Grand <this city>\nThe M\u00e9tropole du Grand <this city>, or simply Grand <this city>, formally came into existence on 1 January 2016. It is an administrative structure for co-operation between the City of <this city> and its nearest suburbs. It includes the City of <this city>, plus the communes of the three departments of the inner suburbs (Hauts-de-Seine, Seine-Saint-Denis and Val-de-Marne), plus seven communes in the outer suburbs, including Argenteuil in Val d'Oise and Paray-Vieille-Poste in Essonne, which were added to include the major airports of <this city>. The Metropole covers 814 km2 (314 sq mi) and has a population of 6.945 million persons.The new structure is administered by a Metropolitan Council of 210 members, not directly elected, but chosen by the councils of the member Communes. By 2020 its basic competencies will include urban planning, housing and protection of the environment. The first president of the metropolitan council, Patrick Ollier, was elected on 22 January 2016. Though the Metropole has a population of nearly seven million people and accounts for 25 percent of the GDP of <this country>, it has a very small budget: just 65 million Euros, compared with eight billion Euros for the City of <this city>.\n\nRegional government\nThe Region of \u00cele de <this country>, including <this city> and its surrounding communities, is governed by the Regional Council, composed of 209 members representing its different communes. On 15 December 2015, a list of candidates of the Union of the Right, a coalition of centrist and right-wing parties, led by Val\u00e9rie P\u00e9cresse, narrowly won the regional election, defeating a coalition of Socialists and ecologists. The Socialists had governed the region for seventeen years. The regional council has 121 members from the Union of the Right, 66 from the Union of the Left and 22 from the extreme right National Front.\n\nNational government\nAs the capital of <this country>, <this city> is the seat of <this country>'s national government. For the executive, the two chief officers each have their own official residences, which also serve as their offices. The President of the French Republic resides at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, while the Prime Minister's seat is at the H\u00f4tel Matignon. Government ministries are located in various parts of the city, many near the H\u00f4tel Matignon.Both houses of the French Parliament are located on the Rive Gauche. The upper house, the Senate, meets in the Palais du Luxembourg, while the more important lower house, the National Assembly, meets in the Palais Bourbon. The President of the Senate, the second-highest public official in <this country> (the President of the Republic being the sole superior), resides in the Petit Luxembourg, a smaller palace annexe to the Palais du Luxembourg.\n<this country>'s highest courts are located in <this city>. The Court of Cassation, the highest court in the judicial order, which reviews criminal and civil cases, is located in the Palais de Justice on the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9, while the Conseil d'\u00c9tat, which provides legal advice to the executive and acts as the highest court in the administrative order, judging litigation against public bodies, is located in the Palais-Royal in the 1st arrondissement. The Constitutional Council, an advisory body with ultimate authority on the constitutionality of laws and government decrees, also meets in the Montpensier wing of the Palais Royal.<this city> and its region host the headquarters of several international organisations including UNESCO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the International Chamber of Commerce, the <this city> Club, the European Space Agency, the International Energy Agency, the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie, the European Union Institute for Security Studies, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, the International Exhibition Bureau, and the International Federation for Human Rights.\n\nPolice force\nThe security of <this city> is mainly the responsibility of the Prefecture of Police of <this city>, a subdivision of the Ministry of the Interior. It supervises the units of the National Police who patrol the city and the three neighbouring departments. It is also responsible for providing emergency services, including the <this city> Fire Brigade. Its headquarters is on Place Louis L\u00e9pine on the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9.There are 43,800 officers under the prefecture, and a fleet of more than 6,000 vehicles, including police cars, motorcycles, fire trucks, boats and helicopters. The national police has its own special unit for riot control and crowd control and security of public buildings, called the Compagnies R\u00e9publicaines de S\u00e9curit\u00e9 (CRS). Vans of CRS agents are frequently seen in the centre of the city when there are demonstrations and public events. The police are supported by the National Gendarmerie, a branch of the French Armed Forces, though their police operations now are supervised by the Ministry of the Interior.Crime in <this city> is similar to that in most large cities. Violent crime is relatively rare in the city centre. Political violence is uncommon, though very large demonstrations may occur in <this city> and other French cities simultaneously. These demonstrations, usually managed by a strong police presence, can turn confrontational and escalate into violence.\n\nCityscape\nUrbanism and architecture\n<this city> is one of the few world capitals that has rarely seen destruction by catastrophe or war. For this, even its earliest history is still visible in its streetmap, and centuries of rulers adding their respective architectural marks on the capital has resulted in an accumulated wealth of history-rich monuments and buildings whose beauty played a large part in giving the city the reputation it has today. At its origin, before the Middle Ages, the city was composed of several islands and sandbanks in a bend of the Seine; of those, two remain today: \u00cele Saint-Louis and the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9. A third one is the 1827 artificially created \u00cele aux Cygnes.\nModern <this city> owes much of its downtown plan and architectural harmony to Napoleon III and his Prefect of the Seine, Baron Haussmann. Between 1853 and 1870 they rebuilt the city centre, created the wide downtown boulevards and squares where the boulevards intersected, imposed standard facades along the boulevards, and required that the facades be built of the distinctive cream-grey \"<this city> stone\". They also built the major parks around the city centre. The high residential population of its city centre also makes it much different from most other western major cities.<this city>'s urbanism laws have been under strict control since the early 17th century, particularly where street-front alignment, building height and building distribution is concerned. The 210 m (690 ft) Tour Montparnasse was both <this city>'s and <this country>'s tallest building since 1973, but this record has been held by the La D\u00e9fense quarter Tour First tower in Courbevoie since its 2011 construction.\n\nHousing\nThe most expensive residential street in <this city> in 2018 by average price per square metre was Avenue Montaigne, at 22,372 euros per square metre. The total number of residences in the City of <this city> in 2011 was 1,356,074, up from a former high of 1,334,815 in 2006. Among these, 1,165,541 (85.9 percent) were main residences, 91,835 (6.8 percent) were secondary residences, and the remaining 7.3 percent were empty (down from 9.2 percent in 2006).Sixty-two percent of its buildings date from 1949 and before, 20 percent were built between 1949 and 1974, and only 18 percent of the buildings remaining were built after that date. Two-thirds of the city's 1.3 million residences are studio and two-room apartments. <this city> averages 1.9 people per residence, a number that has remained constant since the 1980s, but it is much less than \u00cele-de-<this country>'s 2.33 person-per-residence average. Only 33 percent of principal residence <this city>ians own their habitation (against 47 percent for the entire \u00cele-de-<this country>): the major part of the city's population is a rent-paying one. Social or public housing represented 19.9 percent of the city's total residences in 2017. Its distribution varies widely throughout the city, from 2.6 percent of the housing in the wealthy 7th arrondissement, to 39.9 percent in the 19th arrondissement.In February 2019, a <this city> NGO conducted its annual citywide count of homeless persons. They counted 3,641 homeless persons in <this city>, of whom twelve percent were women. More than half had been homeless for more than a year. 2,885 were living in the streets or parks, 298 in train and metro stations, and 756 in other forms of temporary shelter. This was an increase of 588 persons since 2018.\n\nSuburbs\nAside from the 20th-century addition of the Bois de Boulogne, the Bois de Vincennes and the <this city> heliport, <this city>'s administrative limits have remained unchanged since 1860. A greater administrative Seine department had been governing <this city> and its suburbs since its creation in 1790, but the rising suburban population had made it difficult to maintain as a unique entity. To address this problem, the parent \"District de la r\u00e9gion parisienne\" ('district of the <this city> region') was reorganised into several new departments from 1968: <this city> became a department in itself, and the administration of its suburbs was divided between the three new departments surrounding it. The district of the <this city> region was renamed \"\u00cele-de-<this country>\" in 1977, but this abbreviated \"<this city> region\" name is still commonly used today to describe the \u00cele-de-<this country>, and as a vague reference to the entire <this city> agglomeration. Long-intended measures to unite <this city> with its suburbs began on 1 January 2016, when the M\u00e9tropole du Grand <this city> came into existence.<this city>'s disconnect with its suburbs, its lack of suburban transportation, in particular, became all too apparent with the <this city> agglomeration's growth. Paul Delouvrier promised to resolve the <this city>-suburbs m\u00e9sentente when he became head of the <this city> region in 1961: two of his most ambitious projects for the Region were the construction of five suburban \"villes nouvelles\" (\"new cities\") and the RER commuter train network. Many other suburban residential districts (grands ensembles) were built between the 1960s and 1970s to provide a low-cost solution for a rapidly expanding population: These districts were socially mixed at first, but few residents actually owned their homes (the growing economy made these accessible to the middle classes only from the 1970s). Their poor construction quality and their haphazard insertion into existing urban growth contributed to their desertion by those able to move elsewhere and their repopulation by those with more limited possibilities.These areas, quartiers sensibles (\"sensitive quarters\"), are in northern and eastern <this city>, namely around its Goutte d'Or and Belleville neighbourhoods. To the north of the city, they are grouped mainly in the Seine-Saint-Denis department, and to a lesser extreme to the east in the Val-d'Oise department. Other difficult areas are located in the Seine valley, in \u00c9vry et Corbeil-Essonnes (Essonne), in Mureaux, Mantes-la-Jolie (Yvelines), and scattered among social housing districts created by Delouvrier's 1961 \"ville nouvelle\" political initiative.The <this city> agglomeration's urban sociology is basically that of 19th-century <this city>: the wealthy live in the west and southwest, and the middle-to-working classes are in the north and east. The remaining areas are mostly middle-class dotted with wealthy islands located there due to reasons of historical importance, namely Saint-Maur-des-Foss\u00e9s to the east and Enghien-les-Bains to the north of <this city>.\n\nDemographics\nThe official estimated population of the City of <this city> on 1 January 1, 2023 was 2,102,650, down from 2,165,423 on January 1, 2022, according to the INSEE, the official French statistical agency. According to INSEE, the population has dropped by 122,919, or about five percent, over the past decade. The Mayor of <this city>, Anne Hidalgo, declared that this illustrated the \"de-densification\" of the city, creating more green space and less crowding. Despite the drop, <this city> remains the most densely-populated city in Europe, with 252 residents per hectare, not counting parks. This drop was attributed partly to a lower birth rate, the departure of middle-class residents and the possible loss of housing in the city due to short-term rentals for tourism.<this city> is the fourth largest municipality in the European Union, following Berlin, Madrid and Rome. Eurostat places <this city> (6.5 million people) behind London (8 million) and ahead of Berlin (3.5 million), based on the 2012 populations of what Eurostat calls \"urban audit core cities\".\nThe population of <this city> today is lower than its historical peak of 2.9 million in 1921. The principal reasons were a significant decline in household size, and a dramatic migration of residents to the suburbs between 1962 and 1975. Factors in the migration included de-industrialisation, high rent, the gentrification of many inner quarters, the transformation of living space into offices, and greater affluence among working families. The city's population loss came to a temporary halt at the beginning of the 21st century; the population increased from 2,125,246 in 1999 to 2,240,621 in 2012, before declining again slightly in 2017, 2018, and again in 2021.<this city> is the core of a built-up area that extends well beyond its limits: commonly referred to as the agglom\u00e9ration <this city>ienne, and statistically as a unit\u00e9 urbaine (a measure of urban area), the <this city> agglomeration's population of 10,785,092 in 2017 made it the largest urban area in the European Union. City-influenced commuter activity reaches well beyond even this in a statistical aire d'attraction de <this city> (\"functional area\", a statistical method comparable to a metropolitan area), that had a population of 13,024,518 in 2017, 19.6% of the population of <this country>, and the largest metropolitan area in the Eurozone.According to Eurostat, the EU statistical agency, in 2012 the Commune of <this city> was the most densely populated city in the European Union, with 21,616 people per square kilometre within the city limits (the NUTS-3 statistical area), ahead of Inner London West, which had 10,374 people per square kilometre. According to the same census, three departments bordering <this city>, Hauts-de-Seine, Seine-Saint-Denis and Val-de-Marne, had population densities of over 10,000 people per square kilometre, ranking among the 10 most densely populated areas of the EU.\n\nMigration\nPeople born in foreign countries with no French citizenship at birth, are those defined as immigrants under French law. According to the 2012 census, 135,853 residents of the City of <this city> were immigrants from Europe, 112,369 were immigrants from the Maghreb, 70,852 from sub-Saharan Africa and Egypt, 5,059 from Turkey, 91,297 from Asia (outside Turkey), 38,858 from the Americas, and 1,365 from the South Pacific.In the <this city> Region, 590,504 residents were immigrants from Europe, 627,078 were immigrants from the Maghreb, 435,339 from sub-Saharan Africa and Egypt, 69,338 from Turkey, 322,330 from Asia (outside Turkey), 113,363 from the Americas, and 2,261 from the South Pacific.In 2012, there were 8,810 British citizens and 10,019 United States citizens living in the City of <this city> (Ville de <this city>) and 20,466 British citizens and 16,408 United States citizens living in the entire <this city> Region (\u00cele-de-<this country>).\n\nReligion\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century, <this city> was the largest Catholic city in the world. French census data does not contain information about religious affiliation. According to a 2011 survey by the Institut fran\u00e7ais d'opinion publique (IFOP), a French public opinion research organisation, 61 percent of residents of the <this city> Region (\u00cele-de-<this country>) identified themselves as Roman Catholic. In the same survey, 7 percent of residents identified themselves as Muslims, 4 percent as Protestants, 2 percent as Jewish and 25 percent as without religion.\nAccording to the INSEE, between 4 and 5 million French residents were born or had at least one parent born in a predominantly Muslim country, particularly Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia. An IFOP survey in 2008 reported that, of immigrants from these predominantly Muslim countries, 25 percent went to the mosque regularly; 41 percent practised the religion, and 34 percent were believers but did not practice the religion. In 2012 and 2013, it was estimated that there were almost 500,000 Muslims in the City of <this city>, 1.5 million Muslims in the \u00cele-de-<this country> region and 4 to 5 million Muslims in <this country>.The Jewish population of the <this city> Region was estimated in 2014 to be 282,000, the largest concentration of Jews in the world outside of Israel and the United States.\n\nEconomy\nThe economy of the City of <this city> is based largely on services and commerce; of the 390,480 enterprises in the city, 80.6 percent are engaged in commerce, transportation, and diverse services, 6.5 percent in construction, and just 3.8 percent in industry. The story is similar in the <this city> Region (\u00cele-de-<this country>): 76.7 percent of enterprises are engaged in commerce and services, and 3.4 percent in industry.At the 2012 census, 59.5% of jobs in the <this city> Region were in market services (12.0% in wholesale and retail trade, 9.7% in professional, scientific, and technical services, 6.5% in information and communication, 6.5% in transportation and warehousing, 5.9% in finance and insurance, 5.8% in administrative and support services, 4.6% in accommodation and food services, and 8.5% in various other market services), 26.9% in non-market services (10.4% in human health and social work activities, 9.6% in public administration and defence, and 6.9% in education), 8.2% in manufacturing and utilities (6.6% in manufacturing and 1.5% in utilities), 5.2% in construction, and 0.2% in agriculture.The <this city> Region had 5.4 million salaried employees in 2010, of whom 2.2 million were concentrated in 39 p\u00f4les d'emplois or business districts. The largest of these, in terms of number of employees, is known in French as the QCA, or quartier central des affaires; in 2010, it was the workplace of 500,000 salaried employees, about 30 percent of the salaried employees in <this city> and 10 percent of those in the \u00cele-de-<this country>. The largest sectors of activity in the central business district were finance and insurance (16 percent of employees in the district) and business services (15 percent). The district also includes a large concentration of department stores, shopping areas, hotels and restaurants, as well a government offices and ministries. The second-largest business district in terms of employment is La D\u00e9fense, just west of the city. In 2010, it was the workplace of 144,600 employees, of whom 38 percent worked in finance and insurance, 16 percent in business support services. Two other important districts, Neuilly-sur-Seine and Levallois-Perret, are extensions of the <this city> business district and of La D\u00e9fense. Another district, including Boulogne-Billancourt, Issy-les-Moulineaux and the southern part of the 15th arrondissement, is a centre of activity for the media and information technology.The top French companies listed in the Fortune Global 500 for 2021 all have their headquarters in the <this city> Region; six in the central business district of the City of <this city>; and four close to the city in the Hauts-de-Seine Department, three in La D\u00e9fense and one in Boulogne-Billancourt. Some companies, like Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, have offices in both <this city> and La D\u00e9fense. The <this city> Region is <this country>'s leading region for economic activity, with a GDP of \u20ac742 billion and \u20ac59,400 per capita. or around 1/3 of the economy of <this country> in 2019:\u200a12\u200a. In 2021, its GDP ranked first among the metropolitan regions of the EU and its per-capita GDP PPP was the 8th highest. While the <this city> region's population accounted for 18.8 percent of metropolitan <this country> in 2019, the <this city> region's GDP accounted for 32 percent of metropolitan <this country>'s GDP.The <this city> Region economy has gradually shifted from industry to high-value-added service industries (finance, IT services) and high-tech manufacturing (electronics, optics, aerospace, etc.). The <this city> region's most intense economic activity through the central Hauts-de-Seine department and suburban La D\u00e9fense business district places <this city>'s economic centre to the west of the city, in a triangle between the Op\u00e9ra Garnier, La D\u00e9fense and the Val de Seine. While the <this city> economy is dominated by services, and employment in manufacturing sector has declined sharply, the region remains an important manufacturing centre, particularly for aeronautics, automobiles, and \"eco\" industries.In the 2017 worldwide cost of living survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, based on a survey made in September 2016, <this city> ranked as the seventh most expensive city in the world, and the second most expensive in Europe, after Zurich. In 2018, <this city> was the most expensive city in the world with Singapore and Hong Kong. Station F is a business incubator for startups, noted as the world's largest startup facility.\n\nEmployment and income\nThe majority of <this city>'s salaried employees fill 370,000 businesses services jobs, concentrated in the north-western 8th, 16th and 17th arrondissements. <this city>'s financial service companies are concentrated in the central-western 8th and 9th arrondissement banking and insurance district. <this city>'s department store district in the 1st, 6th, 8th and 9th arrondissements employ ten percent of mostly female <this city> workers, with 100,000 of these registered in the retail trade. Fourteen percent of <this city>ians work in hotels and restaurants and other services to individuals. Nineteen percent of <this city> employees work for the State in either administration or education. The majority of <this city>'s healthcare and social workers work at the hospitals and social housing concentrated in the peripheral 13th, 14th, 18th, 19th and 20th arrondissements. Outside <this city>, the western Hauts-de-Seine department La D\u00e9fense district specialising in finance, insurance and scientific research district, employs 144,600, and the north-eastern Seine-Saint-Denis audiovisual sector has 200 media firms and 10 major film studios.<this city>'s manufacturing is mostly focused in its suburbs, and the city itself has only around 75,000 manufacturing workers, most of which are in the textile, clothing, leather goods, and shoe trades. The <this city> region's 800 aerospace companies employed 100,000. Four hundred automobile industry companies employ another 100,000 workers: many of these are centred in the Yvelines department around the Renault and PSA-Citro\u00ebn plants (this department alone employs 33,000), but the industry as a whole suffered a major loss with the 2014 closing of a major Aulnay-sous-Bois Citro\u00ebn assembly plant. The southern Essonne department specialises in science and technology, and the south-eastern Val-de-Marne, with its wholesale Rungis food market, specialises in food processing and beverages. The <this city> region's manufacturing decline is quickly being replaced by eco-industries: these employ about 100,000 workers.Incomes are higher in the Western part of the city and in the western suburbs than in the northern and eastern parts of the urban area. While <this city> has some of the richest neighbourhoods in <this country>, it also has some of the poorest, mostly on the eastern side of the city. In 2012, 14 percent of households in the city earned less than \u20ac977 per month, the official poverty line. Twenty-five percent of residents in the 19th arrondissement lived below the poverty line; in the city's wealthiest neighbourhood, the 7th arrondissement, 7 percent lived below the poverty line. The unemployment rate in <this city> in the 4th trimester of 2021 was six percent, compared with 7.4 percent in the whole of <this country>. This was the lowest rate in thirteen years.\n\nTourism\nTourism continued to recover in the <this city> region in 2022, increasing to 44 million visitors, an increase of 95 percent over 2021, but still 13 percent lower than in 2019.Greater <this city>, comprising <this city> and its three surrounding departments, received 38 million visitors in 2019, a record, measured by hotel arrivals. These included 12.2 million French visitors. Of foreign visitors, the greatest number came from the United States (2.6 million), United Kingdom (1.2 million), Germany (981 thousand) and China (711 thousand).In 2018, measured by the Euromonitor Global Cities Destination Index, <this city> was the second-busiest airline destination in the world, with 19.10 million visitors, behind Bangkok (22.78 million) but ahead of London (19.09 million).

The company paid the city government 7.3 million euros in 2016.\n\nCulture\nPainting and sculpture\nFor centuries, <this city> has attracted artists from around the world. As a result, <this city> has acquired a reputation as the \"City of Art\". Italian artists were a profound influence on the development of art in <this city> in the 16th and 17th centuries, particularly in sculpture and reliefs. Painting and sculpture became the pride of the French monarchy and the French royal family commissioned many <this city>ian artists to adorn their palaces during the French Baroque and Classicism era. Sculptors such as Girardon, Coysevox and Coustou acquired reputations as the finest artists in the royal court in 17th-century <this country>. Pierre Mignard became the first painter to King Louis XIV during this period. In 1648, the Acad\u00e9mie royale de peinture et de sculpture (Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture) was established to accommodate for the dramatic interest in art in the capital. This served as <this country>'s top art school until 1793.<this city> was in its artistic prime in the 19th century and early 20th century, when it had a colony of artists established in the city and in art schools associated with some of the finest painters of the times: Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, \u00c9douard Manet, Claude Monet, Berthe Morisot, Paul Gauguin, Pierre-Auguste Renoir and others. <this city> was central to the development of Romanticism in art, with painters such as G\u00e9ricault. Impressionism, Art Nouveau, Symbolism, Fauvism, Cubism and Art Deco movements all evolved in <this city>. In the late 19th century, many artists in the French provinces and worldwide flocked to <this city> to exhibit their works in the numerous salons and expositions and make a name for themselves. Artists such as Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Vincent van Gogh, Paul C\u00e9zanne, Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Henri Rousseau, Marc Chagall, Amedeo Modigliani and many others became associated with <this city>.\nThe most prestigious sculptors who made their reputation in <this city> in the modern era are Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Auguste Bartholdi (Statue of Liberty), Auguste Rodin, Camille Claudel, Antoine Bourdelle, Paul Landowski (statue of Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro) and Aristide Maillol. The Golden Age of the School of <this city> ended between the two world wars.\n\nMuseums\nThe Louvre received 2,8 million visitors in 2021, up from 2.7 million in 2020, holding its position as first among the most-visited museums. Its treasures include the Mona Lisa (La Joconde), the Venus de Milo statue, and Liberty Leading the People. The second-most visited museum in the city in 2021, with 1.5 million visitors, was the Centre Georges Pompidou, also known as Beaubourg, which houses the Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne The third most visited <this city> museum in 2021 was the National Museum of Natural History with 1,4 million visitors. It is famous for its dinosaur artefacts, mineral collections and its Gallery of Evolution. It was followed by the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, featuring 19th century art and the French Impressionists, which had one million visitors. <this city> hosts one of the largest science museums in Europe, the Cit\u00e9 des sciences et de l'industrie, (984,000 visitors in 2020). The other most-visited <this city> museums in 2021 were the Fondation Louis Vuitton (691,000), the Mus\u00e9e du Quai Branly \u2013 Jacques Chirac, featuring the indigenous art and cultures of Africa, Asia, Oceania, and the Americas. (616,000); the Mus\u00e9e Carnavalet (History of <this city>) (606,000), and the Petit Palais, the art museum of the City of <this city> (518,000).\nThe Mus\u00e9e de l'Orangerie, near both the Louvre and the Orsay, also exhibits Impressionists and Post-Impressionists, including most of Claude Monet's large Water Lilies murals. The Mus\u00e9e national du Moyen \u00c2ge, or Cluny Museum, presents Medieval art. The Guimet Museum, or Mus\u00e9e national des arts asiatiques, has one of the largest collections of Asian art in Europe. There are also notable museums devoted to individual artists, including the Mus\u00e9e Picasso, the Mus\u00e9e Rodin and the Mus\u00e9e national Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix.\nThe military history of <this country> is presented by displays at the Mus\u00e9e de l'Arm\u00e9e at Les Invalides. In addition to the national museums, run by the Ministry of Culture, the City of <this city> operates 14 museums, including the Carnavalet Museum on the history of <this city>, Mus\u00e9e d'Art Moderne de la Ville de <this city>, Palais de Tokyo, the House of Victor Hugo, the House of Balzac and the Catacombs of <this city>. There are also notable private museums. The Contemporary Art museum of the Louis Vuitton Foundation, designed by architect Frank Gehry, opened in October 2014 in the Bois de Boulogne.\n\nTheatre\nThe largest opera houses of <this city> are the 19th-century Op\u00e9ra Garnier (historical <this city> Op\u00e9ra) and modern Op\u00e9ra Bastille; the former tends toward the more classic ballets and operas, and the latter provides a mixed repertoire of classic and modern. In the middle of the 19th century, there were three other active and competing opera houses: the Op\u00e9ra-Comique (which still exists), Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien and Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Lyrique (which in modern times changed its profile and name to Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Ville).

The Jardin des plantes was the first botanical garden in <this city>, created in 1626.Between 1853 and 1870, Emperor Napoleon III and the city's first director of parks and gardens, Jean-Charles Adolphe Alphand, created the Bois de Boulogne, Bois de Vincennes, Parc Montsouris and Parc des Buttes-Chaumont, located at the four points of the compass around the city, as well as many smaller parks, squares and gardens in the <this city>'s quarters. Since 1977, the city has created 166 new parks, most notably the Parc de la Villette (1987), Parc Andr\u00e9 Citro\u00ebn (1992), Parc de Bercy (1997) and Parc Clichy-Batignolles (2007). One of the newest parks, the Promenade des Berges de la Seine (2013), built on a former highway on the left bank of the Seine between the Pont de l'Alma and the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, has floating gardens.\n\nCemeteries\nDuring the Roman era, the city's main cemetery was located to the outskirts of the left bank settlement, but this changed with the rise of Catholic Christianity, where most every inner-city church had adjoining burial grounds for use by their parishes. With <this city>'s growth many of these, particularly the city's largest cemetery, the Holy Innocents' Cemetery, were filled to overflowing. When inner-city burials were condemned from 1786, the contents of all <this city>'s parish cemeteries were transferred to a renovated section of <this city>'s stone mines, today place Denfert-Rochereau in the 14th arrondissement.After a tentative creation of several smaller suburban cemeteries, the Prefect Nicholas Frochot under Napoleon Bonaparte provided a more definitive solution in the creation of three massive <this city>ian cemeteries outside the city limits. Open from 1804, these were the cemeteries of P\u00e8re Lachaise, Montmartre, Montparnasse, and later Passy. New suburban cemeteries were created in the early 20th century: The largest of these are the Cimeti\u00e8re parisien de Saint-Ouen, the Cimeti\u00e8re parisien de Pantin (also known as Cimeti\u00e8re parisien de Pantin-Bobigny), the Cimeti\u00e8re parisien d'Ivry, and the Cimeti\u00e8re parisien de Bagneux. Famous people buried in <this city>ian cemeteries include Oscar Wilde, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin, Jim Morrison, \u00c9dith Piaf and Serge Gainsbourg.\n\nEducation\n<this city> is the d\u00e9partement with the highest proportion of highly educated people. In 2009, around 40 percent of <this city>ians held a licence-level diploma or higher, the highest proportion in <this country>, while 13 percent have no diploma, the third-lowest percentage in <this country>. Education in <this city> and the \u00cele-de-<this country> region employs approximately 330,000 people, 170,000 of whom are teachers and professors teaching approximately 2.9 million students in around 9,000 primary, secondary, and higher education schools and institutions.The University of <this city>, founded in the 12th century, is often called the Sorbonne after one of its original medieval colleges. It was broken up into thirteen autonomous universities in 1970, following the student demonstrations in 1968. Most of the campuses today are in the Latin Quarter where the old university was located, while others are scattered around the city and the suburbs.The <this city> region hosts <this country>'s highest concentration of the grandes \u00e9coles \u2013 55 specialised centres of higher-education outside or inside the public university structure. The prestigious public universities are usually considered grands \u00e9tablissements. Most of the grandes \u00e9coles were relocated to the suburbs of <this city> in the 1960s and 1970s, in new campuses much larger than the old campuses within the crowded City of <this city>, though the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, PSL University has remained on rue d'Ulm in the 5th arrondissement.\n\nHealthcare\nHealth care and emergency medical service in the City of <this city> and its suburbs are provided by the Assistance publique \u2013 H\u00f4pitaux de <this city> (AP-HP), a public hospital system that employs more than 90,000 people (including practitioners, support personnel, and administrators) in 44 hospitals. It is the largest hospital system in Europe. It provides health care, teaching, research, prevention, education and emergency medical service in 52 branches of medicine. The hospitals receive more than 5.8 million annual patient visits.One of the most notable hospitals is the H\u00f4tel-Dieu, founded in 651, the oldest hospital in the city and the oldest worldwide still operating, although the current building is the product of a reconstruction of 1877. Other hospitals include Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital (one of the largest in Europe), H\u00f4pital Cochin, Bichat\u2013Claude Bernard Hospital, H\u00f4pital Europ\u00e9en Georges-Pompidou, Bic\u00eatre Hospital, Beaujon Hospital, the Curie Institute, Lariboisi\u00e8re Hospital, Necker\u2013Enfants Malades Hospital, H\u00f4pital Saint-Louis, H\u00f4pital de la Charit\u00e9 and the American Hospital of <this city>.\n\nInternational relations\nInternational organisations\nThe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has had its headquarters in <this city> since November 1958. <this city> is also the home of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). <this city> hosts the headquarters of the European Space Agency, the International Energy Agency, European Securities and Markets Authority and the European Banking Authority.\n\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities\nSince 9 April 1956, <this city> is exclusively and reciprocally twinned with:\n Rome, 1956Seule <this city> est digne de Rome; seule Rome est digne de <this city>.
