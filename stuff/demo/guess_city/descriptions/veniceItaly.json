  "wiki_text": "<this city> ( VEN-iss; Italian: Venezia [ve\u02c8n\u025bttsja] (listen); Venetian: Venesia [ve\u02c8n\u025bsja], outdatedly Venexia [ve\u02c8n\u025bzja]) is a city in northeastern <this country> and the capital of the Veneto region. It is built on a group of 118 small islands that are separated by expanses of open water and by canals; portions of the city are linked by over 400 bridges. The islands are in the shallow Venetian Lagoon, an enclosed bay lying between the mouths of the Po and the Piave rivers (more exactly between the Brenta and the Sile). In 2020, around 258,685 people resided in greater <this city> or the Comune di Venezia, of whom around 51,000 live in the historical island city of <this city> (centro storico) and the rest on the mainland (terraferma). Together with the cities of Padua and Treviso, <this city> is included in the Padua-Treviso-<this city> Metropolitan Area (PATREVE), which is considered a statistical metropolitan area, with a total population of 2.6 million.The name is derived from the ancient Veneti people who inhabited the region by the 10th century BC. The city was historically the capital of the Republic of <this city> for almost a millennium, from 810 to 1797. It was a major financial and maritime power during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, and a staging area for the Crusades and the Battle of Lepanto, as well as an important centre of commerce\u2014especially silk, grain, and spice, and of art from the 13th century to the end of the 17th. The city-state of <this city> is considered to have been the first real international financial centre, emerging in the 9th century and reaching its greatest prominence in the 14th century. This made <this city> a wealthy city throughout most of its history. For centuries <this city> possessed numerous territories along the Adriatic Sea and within the Italian peninsula, leaving a significant impact on the architecture and culture that can still be seen today. The sovereignty of <this city> came to an end in 1797, at the hands of Napoleon. Subsequently, in 1866, the city became part of the Kingdom of <this country>.<this city> has been known as \"La Dominante\", \"La Serenissima\", \"Queen of the Adriatic\", \"City of Water\", \"City of Masks\", \"City of Bridges\", \"The Floating City\", and \"City of Canals\". The lagoon and the historic parts of the city within the lagoon were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987, covering an area of 70,176.4 hectares (173,410 acres). In view of the fact that <this city> and its lagoon are under constant threat in terms of their ecology and the safeguarding of the cultural heritage, <this city>'s UNESCO listing has been under constant examination by UNESCO. Parts of <this city> are renowned for the beauty of their settings, their architecture, and artwork. <this city> is known for several important artistic movements\u2014especially during the Renaissance period\u2014and has played an important role in the history of instrumental and operatic music; it is the birthplace of Baroque composers Tomaso Albinoni and Antonio Vivaldi.In the 21st century, <this city> remains a very popular tourist destination, a major cultural centre, and has been ranked many times the most beautiful city in the world. The city faces challenges including an excessive number of tourists in the centro storico as well as problems caused by pollution, tide peaks and cruise ships sailing too close to buildings. It has been described by The Times as one of Europe's most romantic cities and by The New York Times as \"undoubtedly the most beautiful city built by man\".\n\nHistory\nOrigins\nAlthough no surviving historical records deal directly with the founding of <this city>, tradition and the available evidence have led several historians to agree that the original population of <this city> consisted of refugees\u2014from nearby Roman cities such as Padua, Aquileia, Treviso, Altino, and Concordia (modern Portogruaro), as well as from the undefended countryside\u2014who were fleeing successive waves of Germanic and Hun invasions. This is further supported by the documentation on the so-called \"apostolic families\", the twelve founding families of <this city> who elected the first doge, who in most cases trace their lineage back to Roman families. Some late Roman sources reveal the existence of fishermen, on the islands in the original marshy lagoons, who were referred to as incolae lacunae (\"lagoon dwellers\"). The traditional founding is identified with the dedication of the first church, that of San Giacomo on the islet of Rialto (Rivoalto, \"High Shore\")\u2014said to have taken place at the stroke of noon on 25 March 421 (the Feast of the Annunciation).Beginning as early as AD 166\u2013168, the Quadi and Marcomanni destroyed the main Roman town in the area, present-day Oderzo. This part of Roman <this country> was again overrun in the early 5th century by the Visigoths and, some 50 years later, by the Huns led by Attila. The last and most enduring immigration into the north of the Italian peninsula, that of the Lombards in 568, left the Eastern Roman Empire only a small strip of coastline in the current Veneto, including <this city>. The Roman/Byzantine territory was organized as the Exarchate of Ravenna, administered from that ancient port and overseen by a viceroy (the Exarch) appointed by the Emperor in Constantinople. Ravenna and <this city> were connected only by sea routes, and with the Venetians' isolation came increasing autonomy. New ports were built, including those at Malamocco and Torcello in the Venetian lagoon. The tribuni maiores formed the earliest central standing governing committee of the islands in the lagoon, dating from c. 568.\nThe traditional first doge of <this city>, Paolo Lucio Anafesto (Anafestus Paulicius), was elected in 697, as written in the oldest chronicle by John, deacon of <this city> c.\u20091008. Some modern historians claim Paolo Lucio Anafesto was actually the Exarch Paul, and Paul's successor, Marcello Tegalliano, was Paul's magister militum (or \"general\"), literally \"master of soldiers\". In 726 the soldiers and citizens of the exarchate rose in a rebellion over the iconoclastic controversy, at the urging of Pope Gregory II. The exarch, held responsible for the acts of his master, Byzantine Emperor Leo III, was murdered, and many officials were put to flight in the chaos. At about this time, the people of the lagoon elected their own independent leader for the first time, although the relationship of this to the uprisings is not clear. Ursus was the first of 117 \"doges\" (doge) is the Venetian dialectal equivalent of the Latin dux (\"leader\"); the corresponding word in English is duke, in standard Italian duca.  (See also \"duce\".) Whatever his original views, Ursus supported Emperor Leo III's successful military expedition to recover Ravenna, sending both men and ships. In recognition of this, <this city> was \"granted numerous privileges and concessions\" and Ursus, who had personally taken the field, was confirmed by Leo as dux. and given the added title of hypatus (from the Greek for \"consul\").In 751, the Lombard King Aistulf conquered most of the Exarchate of Ravenna, leaving <this city> a lonely and increasingly autonomous Byzantine outpost. During this period, the seat of the local Byzantine governor (the \"duke/dux\", later \"doge\"), was at Malamocco. Settlement on the islands in the lagoon probably increased with the Lombard conquest of other Byzantine territories, as refugees sought asylum in the area. In 775/6, the episcopal seat of Olivolo (San Pietro di Castello) was created. During the reign of duke Agnello Particiaco (811\u2013827) the ducal seat moved from Malamocco to the more protected Rialto, within present-day <this city>. The monastery of St. Zachary and the first ducal palace and basilica of St. Mark, as well as a walled defense (civitatis murus) between Olivolo and Rialto, were subsequently built here.\nCharlemagne sought to subdue the city to his rule. He ordered the pope to expel the Venetians from the Pentapolis along the Adriatic coast; Charlemagne's own son Pepin of <this country>, king of the Lombards, under the authority of his father, embarked on a siege of <this city> itself. This, however, proved a costly failure. The siege lasted six months, with Pepin's army ravaged by the diseases of the local swamps and eventually forced to withdraw in 810. A few months later, Pepin himself died, apparently as a result of a disease contracted there. In the aftermath, an agreement between Charlemagne and the Byzantine Emperor Nicephorus in 814 recognized <this city> as Byzantine territory, and granted the city trading rights along the Adriatic coast.\nIn 828 the new city's prestige increased with the acquisition, from Alexandria, of relics claimed to be of St Mark the Evangelist; these were placed in the new basilica. Winged lions\u2014visible throughout <this city>\u2014are the emblem of St Mark.  The patriarchal seat was also moved to Rialto. As the community continued to develop, and as Byzantine power waned, its own autonomy grew, leading to eventual independence.\n\nExpansion\nFrom the 9th to the 12th centuries, <this city> developed into a powerful maritime empire (an Italian thalassocracy known also as repubblica marinara). In addition to <this city> there were seven others: the most important ones were Genoa, Pisa, and Amalfi; and the lesser known were Ragusa, Ancona, Gaeta and Noli. Its own strategic position at the head of the Adriatic made Venetian naval and commercial power almost invulnerable. With the elimination of pirates along the Dalmatian coast, the city became a flourishing trade centre between Western Europe and the rest of the world, especially with the Byzantine Empire and Asia, where its navy protected sea routes against piracy.\nThe Republic of <this city> seized a number of places on the eastern shores of the Adriatic before 1200, mostly for commercial reasons, because pirates based there were a menace to trade. The doge already possessed the titles of Duke of Dalmatia and Duke of Istria. Later mainland possessions, which extended across Lake Garda as far west as the Adda River, were known as the Terraferma; they were acquired partly as a buffer against belligerent neighbours, partly to guarantee Alpine trade routes, and partly to ensure the supply of mainland wheat (on which the city depended). In building its maritime commercial empire, <this city> dominated the trade in salt, acquired control of most of the islands in the Aegean, including Crete, and Cyprus in the Mediterranean, and \nbecame a major power-broker in the Near East. By the standards of the time, <this city>'s stewardship of its mainland territories was relatively enlightened and the citizens of such towns as Bergamo, Brescia, and Verona rallied to the defence of Venetian sovereignty when it was threatened by invaders.\n<this city> remained closely associated with Constantinople, being twice granted trading privileges in the Eastern Roman Empire, through the so-called golden bulls or \"chrysobulls\", in return for aiding the Eastern Empire to resist Norman and Turkish incursions. In the first chrysobull, <this city> acknowledged its homage to the empire; but not in the second, reflecting the decline of Byzantium and the rise of <this city>'s power.<this city> became an imperial power following the Fourth Crusade, which, having veered off course, culminated in 1204 by capturing and sacking Constantinople and establishing the Latin Empire. As a result of this conquest, considerable Byzantine plunder was brought back to <this city>. This plunder included the gilt bronze horses from the Hippodrome of Constantinople, which were originally placed above the entrance to the cathedral of <this city>, St Mark's Basilica (The originals have been replaced with replicas, and are now stored within the basilica.)  After the fall of Constantinople, the former Eastern Roman Empire was partitioned among the Latin crusaders and the Venetians. <this city> subsequently carved out a sphere of influence in the Mediterranean known as the Duchy of the Archipelago, and captured Crete.\nThe seizure of Constantinople proved as decisive a factor in ending the Byzantine Empire as the loss of the Anatolian themes, after Manzikert. Although the Byzantines recovered control of the ravaged city a half-century later, the Byzantine Empire was terminally weakened, and existed as a ghost of its old self, until Sultan Mehmet The Conqueror took the city in 1453.\nSituated on the Adriatic Sea, <this city> had always traded extensively with the Byzantine Empire and the Middle East. By the late 13th century, <this city> was the most prosperous city in all of Europe. At the peak of its power and wealth, it had 36,000 sailors operating 3,300 ships, dominating Mediterranean commerce. <this city>'s leading families vied with each other to build the grandest palaces and to support the work of the greatest and most talented artists. The city was governed by the Great Council, which was made up of members of the noble families of <this city>. The Great Council appointed all public officials, and elected a Senate of 200 to 300 individuals. Since this group was too large for efficient administration, a Council of Ten (also called the Ducal Council, or the Signoria), controlled much of the administration of the city. One member of the great council was elected \"doge\", or duke, to be the chief executive; he would usually hold the title until his death, although several Doges were forced, by pressure from their oligarchical peers, to resign and retire into monastic seclusion, when they were felt to have been discredited by political failure.\n\nThe Venetian governmental structure was similar in some ways to the republican system of ancient Rome, with an elected chief executive (the doge), a senator-like assembly of nobles, and the general citizenry with limited political power, who originally had the power to grant or withhold their approval of each newly elected doge. Church and various private property was tied to military service, although there was no knight tenure within the city itself. The Cavalieri di San Marco was the only order of chivalry ever instituted in <this city>, and no citizen could accept or join a foreign order without the government's consent. <this city> remained a republic throughout its independent period, and politics and the military were kept separate, except when on occasion the Doge personally headed the military. War was regarded as a continuation of commerce by other means. Therefore, the city's early employment of large numbers of mercenaries for service elsewhere, and later its reliance on foreign mercenaries when the ruling class was preoccupied with commerce.\n\nAlthough the people of <this city> generally remained orthodox Roman Catholics, the state of <this city> was notable for its freedom from religious fanaticism, and executed nobody for religious heresy during the Counter-Reformation. This apparent lack of zeal contributed to <this city>'s frequent conflicts with the papacy. In this context, the writings of the Anglican divine William Bedell are particularly illuminating. <this city> was threatened with the interdict on a number of occasions and twice suffered its imposition. The second, most noted, occasion was in 1606, by order of Pope Paul V.The newly invented German printing press spread rapidly throughout Europe in the 15th century, and <this city> was quick to adopt it. By 1482, <this city> was the printing capital of the world; the leading printer was Aldus Manutius, who invented paperback books that could be carried in a saddlebag. His Aldine Editions included translations of nearly all the known Greek manuscripts of the era.\n\nDecline\n<this city>'s long decline started in the 15th century. <this city> confronted the Ottoman Empire in the Siege of Thessalonica (1422\u20131430) and sent ships to help defend Constantinople against the besieging Turks in 1453. After the Fall of Constantinople, Sultan Mehmed II declared the first of a series of Ottoman-Venetian wars that cost <this city> much of its eastern Mediterranean possessions. Vasco da Gama's 1497\u20131499 voyage opened a sea route to India around the Cape of Good Hope and destroyed <this city>'s monopoly. <this city>'s oared vessels  were at a disadvantage when it came to traversing oceans, therefore <this city> was left behind in the race for colonies.The Black Death devastated <this city> in 1348 and struck again between 1575 and 1577. In three years, the plague killed some 50,000 people. In 1630, the Italian plague of 1629\u201331 killed a third of <this city>'s 150,000 citizens.<this city> began to lose the position as a centre of international trade during the later part of the Renaissance as Portugal became Europe's principal intermediary in the trade with the East, striking at the very foundation of <this city>'s great wealth. France and Spain fought for hegemony over <this country> in the Italian Wars, marginalising its political influence. However, <this city> remained a major exporter of agricultural products and until the mid-18th century, a significant manufacturing centre.\n\nModern age\nThe Republic of <this city> lost its independence when Napoleon Bonaparte conquered <this city> on 12 May 1797 during the War of the First Coalition. Napoleon was seen as something of a liberator by the city's Jewish population. He removed the gates of the Ghetto and ended the restrictions on when and where Jews could live and travel in the city.\n<this city> became Austrian territory when Napoleon signed the Treaty of Campo Formio on 12 October 1797. The Austrians took control of the city on 18 January 1798. <this city> was taken from Austria by the Treaty of Pressburg in 1805 and became part of Napoleon's Kingdom of <this country>. It was returned to Austria following Napoleon's defeat in 1814, when it became part of the Austrian-held Kingdom of Lombardy\u2013Venetia. In 1848 a revolt briefly re-established the Venetian republic under Daniele Manin, but this was crushed in 1849. In 1866, after the Third Italian War of Independence, <this city>, along with the rest of the Veneto, became part of the newly created Kingdom of <this country>.\nFrom the middle of the 18th century, Trieste and papal Ancona, both of which became free ports, competed with <this city> more and more economically. Habsburg Trieste in particular boomed and increasingly served trade via the Suez Canal, which opened in 1869, between Asia and Central Europe, while <this city> very quickly lost its competitive edge and commercial strength.During the Second World War, the historic city was largely free from attack, the only aggressive effort of note being Operation Bowler, a successful Royal Air Force precision strike on the German naval operations in the city in March 1945. The targets were destroyed with virtually no architectural damage inflicted on the city itself. However, the industrial areas in Mestre and Marghera and the railway lines to Padua, Trieste, and Trento were repeatedly bombed. On 29 April 1945, a force of British and New Zealand troops of the British Eighth Army, under Lieutenant General Freyberg, liberated <this city>, which had been a hotbed of anti-Mussolini Italian partisan activity.\n\nGeography\n<this city> is located in northeastern <this country>, in the Veneto region. The city is situated on a group of 118 small islands that are separated by canals and linked by bridges. The historic center of <this city> is divided into six districts, or sestieri, which are named Cannaregio, Castello, Dorsoduro, San Marco, San Polo, and Santa Croce.\n<this city> sits atop alluvial silt washed into the sea by the rivers flowing eastward from the alps across the Veneto plain, with the silt being stretched into long banks, or lidi, by the action of the current flowing around the head of the Adriatic Sea from east to west.\n\nSubsidence\nSubsidence, the gradual lowering of the surface of <this city>, has contributed\u2014along with other factors\u2014to the seasonal Acqua alta (\"high water\") when the city's lowest lying surfaces may be covered at high tide.\n\nBuilding foundations\nThose fleeing barbarian invasions who found refuge on the sandy islands of Torcello, Iesolo, and Malamocco, in this coastal lagoon, learned to build by driving closely spaced piles consisting of the trunks of alder trees, a wood noted for its water resistance, into the mud and sand, until they reached a much harder layer of compressed clay. Building foundations rested on plates of Istrian limestone placed on top of the piles.\n\nFlooding\nBetween autumn and early spring, the city is often threatened by flood tides pushing in from the Adriatic. Six hundred years ago, Venetians protected themselves from land-based attacks by diverting all the major rivers flowing into the lagoon and thus preventing sediment from filling the area around the city. This created an ever-deeper lagoon environment. Additionally, the lowest part of <this city>, St. Mark's Basilica, is only 64 centimetres (25 in) above sea level, and one of the most flood-prone parts of the city.In 1604, to defray the cost of flood relief, <this city> introduced what could be considered the first example of a \"stamp tax\". When the revenue fell short of expectations in 1608, <this city> introduced paper, with the superscription \"AQ\" and imprinted instructions, which was to be used for \"letters to officials\". At first, this was to be a temporary tax, but it remained in effect until the fall of the Republic in 1797. Shortly after the introduction of the tax, Spain produced similar paper for general taxation purposes, and the practice spread to other countries.\nDuring the 20th century, when many artesian wells were sunk into the periphery of the lagoon to draw water for local industry, <this city> began to subside. It was realized that extraction of water from the aquifer was the cause. The sinking has slowed markedly since artesian wells were banned in the 1960s. However, the city is still threatened by more frequent low-level floods\u2014the Acqua alta, that rise to a height of several centimetres over its quays\u2014regularly following certain tides. In many old houses, staircases once used to unload goods are now flooded, rendering the former ground floor uninhabitable.Studies indicate that the city continues sinking at a relatively slow rate of 1\u20132 mm per annum; therefore, the state of alert has not been revoked.\nIn May 2003, Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi inaugurated the MOSE Project (Modulo Sperimentale Elettromeccanico), an experimental model for evaluating the performance of hollow floatable gates, expected to be completed in late 2023; the idea is to fix a series of 78 hollow pontoons to the sea bed across the three entrances to the lagoon. When tides are predicted to rise above 110 cm, the pontoons will be filled with air, causing them to float on lagoon side while hinged at sea floor on seaside, thus blocking the incoming water from the Adriatic Sea. This engineering work was due to be completed by 2018. A Reuters report stated that the MOSE Project attributed the delay to \"corruption scandals\". The project is not guaranteed to be successful and the cost has been very high, with as much as approximately \u20ac2 billion of the cost lost to corruption.According to a spokesman for the FAI:\n\nMose is a pharaonic project that should have cost \u20ac800m [\u00a3675m] but will cost at least \u20ac7bn [\u00a36bn]. If the barriers are closed at only 90 cm of high water, most of St Mark's will be flooded anyway; but if closed at very high levels only, then people will wonder at the logic of spending such sums on something that didn't solve the problem. And pressure will come from the cruise ships to keep the gates open.\nOn 13 November 2019, <this city> was flooded when waters peaked at 1.87 m (6 ft), the highest tide since 1966 (1.94 m). More than 80% of the city was covered by water, which damaged cultural heritage sites, including more than 50 churches, leading to tourists cancelling their visits. The planned flood barrier would have prevented this incident according to various sources, including Marco Piana, the head of conservation at St Mark's Basilica. The mayor promised that work on the flood barrier would continue, and the Prime Minister announced that the government would be accelerating the project.\nThe city's mayor, Luigi Brugnaro, blamed the floods on climate change. The chambers of the Regional Council of Veneto began to be flooded around 10 pm, two minutes after the council rejected a plan to combat global warming. One of the effects of climate change is sea level rise which causes an increase in frequency and magnitude of floodings in the city. A Washington Post report provided a more thorough analysis:\"The sea level has been rising even more rapidly in <this city> than in other parts of the world. At the same time, the city is sinking, the result of tectonic plates shifting below the Italian coast. Those factors together, along with the more frequent extreme weather events associated with climate change, contribute to floods.\"\nHenk Ovink, an expert on flooding, told CNN that, while environmental factors are part of the problem, \"historic floods in <this city> are not only a result of the climate crisis but poor infrastructure and mismanagement\".The government of <this country> committed to providing 20 million euros in funding to help the city repair the most urgent aspects although Brugnaro's estimate of the total damage was \"hundreds of millions\" to at least 1 billion euros.On 3 October 2020, the MOSE was activated for the first time in response to a predicted high tide event, preventing some of the low-lying parts of the city (in particular the Piazza San Marco) from being flooded.\n\nClimate\nAccording to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, <this city> has a mid-latitude, four season humid subtropical climate (Cfa), with cool, damp winters and warm, humid summers. The 24-hour average temperature in January is 3.3 \u00b0C (37.9 \u00b0F), and for July this figure is 23.0 \u00b0C (73.4 \u00b0F). Precipitation is spread relatively evenly throughout the year, and averages 748 millimetres (29.4 in); snow isn't a rarity between late November and early March. During the most severe winters, the canals and parts of the lagoon can freeze, but with the warming trend of the past 30\u201340 years, the occurrence has become rarer.\n\nDemographics\nThe city was one of the largest in Europe in the High Middle Ages, with a population of 60,000 in AD 1000; 80,000 in 1200; and rising up to 110,000\u2013180,000 in 1300. In the mid-1500s the city's population was 170,000, and by 1600 it approached 200,000.In 2021, there were 254,850 people residing in the Comune of <this city> (the population figure includes 50,434 in the historic city of <this city> (Centro storico), 177,621 in Terraferma (the mainland); and 26,795 on other islands in the lagoon). 47.8% of the population in 2021 were male and 52.2% were female; minors (ages 18 and younger) were 14.7% of the population compared to elderly people (ages 65 and older) who numbered 27.9%. This compared with the Italian average of 16.7% and 23.5%, respectively. The average age of <this city> residents was 48.6 compared to the Italian average of 45.9. In the five years between 2016 and 2021, the population of <this city> declined by 2.7%, while <this country> as a whole declined by 2.2%. The population in the historic old city declined much faster: from about 120,000 in 1980 to about 60,000 in 2009, and to 50,000 in 2021. As of 2021, 84.2% of the population was Italian. The largest immigrant groups include: 7,814 (3.1%) Bangladeshis, 6,258 (2.5%) Romanians, 4,054 (1.6%) Moldovans, 4,014 (1.6%) Chinese, and 2,514 (1%) Ukrainians.<this city> is predominantly Roman Catholic (85.0% of the resident population in the area of the Patriarchate of <this city> in 2018), but because of the long-standing relationship with Constantinople, there is also a noticeable Orthodox presence; and as a result of immigration, there is now a large Muslim community (about 25,000 or 9.5% of city population in 2018) and some Hindu, and Buddhist inhabitants.\nSince 1991, the Church of San Giorgio dei Greci in <this city> has become the see of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of <this country> and Malta and Exarchate of Southern Europe, a Byzantine-rite diocese under the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople.There is also a historic Jewish community in <this city>. The Venetian Ghetto was the area in which Jews were compelled to live under the Venetian Republic. The word ghetto (gh\u00e8to), originally Venetian, is now found in many languages. Shakespeare's play The Merchant of <this city>, written in the late 16th century, features Shylock, a Venetian Jew. The first complete and uncensored printed edition of the Talmud was printed in <this city> by Daniel Bomberg in 1523. During World War II, Jews were rounded up in <this city> and deported to extermination camps. Since the end of the war, the Jewish population of <this city> has declined from 1500 to about 500. Only around 30 Jews live in the former ghetto, which houses the city's major Jewish institutions. In modern times, <this city> has an eruv, used by the Jewish community.\n\nGovernment\nLocal and regional government\nThe legislative body of the Comune is the City Council (Consiglio Comunale), which is composed of 36 councillors elected every five years with a proportional system, contextually to the mayoral elections. The executive body is the City Administration (Giunta Comunale), composed of 12 assessors nominated and presided over by a directly elected Mayor.\n<this city> was governed by centre-left parties from the early 1990s until the 2010s, when the Mayor started to be elected directly. Its region, Veneto, has long been a conservative stronghold, with the coalition between the regionalist Lega Nord and the centre-right Forza Italia winning absolute majorities of the electorate in many elections at local, national, and regional levels.\nThe current Mayor of <this city> is Luigi Brugnaro, a centre-right independent businessman who is currently serving his second term in office.\nThe municipality of <this city> is also subdivided into six administrative boroughs (municipalit\u00e0). Each borough is governed by a council (Consiglio) and a president, elected every five years. The urban organization is dictated by Article 114 of the Italian Constitution. The boroughs have the power to advise the Mayor with nonbinding opinions on a large spectrum of topics (environment, construction, public health, local markets) and exercise the functions delegated to them by the City Council; in addition, they are supplied with autonomous funding to finance local activities.\nThe boroughs are:\n\nNotes\n\nSestieri\nThe historic city of <this city> has historically been divided into six sestieri, and is made up of a total of 127 individual islands, most of which are separated from their neighbors by narrow channels only.\nEach sestiere is now a statistical and historical area without any degree of autonomy.The six fingers or phalanges of the ferro on the bow of a gondola represent the six sestieri.The sestieri are divided into parishes \u2013 initially 70 in 1033, but reduced under Napoleon, and now numbering just 38. These parishes predate the sestieri, which were created in about 1170. Each parish exhibited unique characteristics but also belonged to an integrated network. Each community chose its own patron saint, staged its own festivals, congregated around its own market centre, constructed its own bell towers, and developed its own customs.Other islands of the Venetian Lagoon do not form part of any of the sestieri, having historically enjoyed a considerable degree of autonomy.Each sestiere has its own house numbering system. Each house has a unique number in the district, from one to several thousand, generally numbered from one corner of the area to another, but not usually in a readily understandable manner.\n\nEconomy\n<this city>'s economy has changed throughout history. Although there is little specific information about the earliest years, it is likely that an important source of the city's prosperity was the trade in slaves, captured in central Europe and sold to North Africa and the Levant. <this city>'s location at the head of the Adriatic, and directly south of the terminus of the Brenner Pass over the Alps, would have given it a distinct advantage as a middleman in this important trade. In the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, <this city> was a major centre for commerce and trade, as it controlled a vast sea-empire, and became an extremely wealthy European city and a leader in political and economic affairs. From the 11th century until the 15th century, pilgrimages to the Holy Land were offered in <this city>. Other ports such as Genoa, Pisa, Marseille, Ancona, and Dubrovnik were hardly able to compete with the well organized transportation of pilgrims from <this city>.\nArmenian merchants from Julfa were the leading traders in <this city>, especially the Sceriman family in the 17th century. They were specialized in the gems and diamonds business. The trade volume reached millions of tons, which was exceptional for 17th century. This all changed by the 17th century, when <this city>'s trade empire was taken over by countries such as Portugal, and its importance as a naval power was reduced. In the 18th century, it became a major agricultural and industrial exporter. The 18th century's biggest industrial complex was the <this city> Arsenal, and the Italian Army still uses it today (even though some space has been used for major theatrical and cultural productions, and as spaces for art). Since World War II, many Venetians have moved to the neighboring cities of Mestre and Porto Marghera, seeking employment as well as affordable housing.Today, <this city>'s economy is mainly based on tourism, shipbuilding (mainly in Mestre and Porto Marghera), services, trade, and industrial exports. Murano glass production in Murano and lace production in Burano are also highly important to the economy.The city is facing financial challenges. In late 2016, it had a major deficit in its budget and debts in excess of  \u20ac400 million. \"In effect, the place is bankrupt\", according to a report by The Guardian. Many locals are leaving the historic centre due to rapidly increasing rents. The declining native population affects the character of the city, as an October 2016 National Geographic article pointed out in its subtitle: \"Residents are abandoning the city, which is in danger of becoming an overpriced theme park\". The city is also facing other challenges, including erosion, pollution, subsidence, an excessive number of tourists in peak periods, and problems caused by oversized cruise ships sailing close to the banks of the historical city.In June 2017, <this country> was required to bail out two Venetian banks\u2014the Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca\u2014to prevent their bankruptcies. Both banks would be wound down and their assets that have value taken over by another Italian bank, Intesa Sanpaolo, which would receive \u20ac5.2 billion as compensation. The Italian government would be responsible for losses from any uncollectible loans from the closed banks. The cost would be \u20ac5.2 billion, with further guarantees to cover bad loans totaling \u20ac12 billion.\n\nTourism\n<this city> is an important destination for tourists who want to see its celebrated art and architecture. The city hosts up to 60,000 tourists per day (2017 estimate). Estimates of the annual number of tourists vary from 22 million to 30 million. This \"overtourism\" creates overcrowding and environmental problems for <this city>'s ecosystem. By 2017, UNESCO was considering the addition of <this city> to its \"In-Danger\" list, which includes historical ruins in war-torn countries. To reduce the number of visitors, who are causing irreversible changes in <this city>, the agency supports limiting the number of cruise ships as well as implementing a strategy for more sustainable tourism.Tourism has been a major part of the Venetian economy since the 18th century, when <this city>\u2014with its beautiful cityscape, uniqueness, and rich musical and artistic cultural heritage\u2014was a stop on the Grand Tour. In the 19th century, <this city> became a fashionable centre for the \"rich and famous\", who often stayed and dined at luxury establishments such as the Danieli Hotel and the Caff\u00e8 Florian, and continued to be a fashionable city into the early 20th century. In the 1980s, the Carnival of <this city> was revived; and the city has become a major centre of international conferences and festivals, such as the prestigious <this city> Biennale and the <this city> Film Festival, which attract visitors from all over the world for their theatrical, cultural, cinematic, artistic, and musical productions.Today, there are numerous attractions in <this city>, such as St Mark's Basilica, the Doge's Palace, the Grand Canal, and the Piazza San Marco. The Lido di Venezia is also a popular international luxury destination, attracting thousands of actors, critics, celebrities, and others in the cinematic industry. The city also relies heavily on the cruise business. The Cruise <this city> Committee has estimated that cruise ship passengers spend more than 150 million euros (US$193 million) annually in the city, according to a 2015 report. Other reports, however, point out that such day-trippers spend relatively little in the few hours of their visits to the city.<this city> is regarded by some as a tourist trap, and by others as a \"living museum\".\n\nMitigating the effects of tourism\nThe need to protect the city's historic environment and fragile canals, in the face of a possible loss of jobs produced by cruise tourism, has seen the Italian Transport Ministry attempt to introduce a ban on large cruise ships visiting the city. A 2013 ban would have allowed only cruise ships smaller than 40,000-gross tons to enter the Giudecca Canal and St Mark's basin. In January 2015, a regional court scrapped the ban, but some global cruise lines indicated that they would continue to respect it until a long-term solution for the protection of <this city> is found.\nP&O Cruises removed <this city> from its summer schedule; Holland America moved one of its ships from this area to Alaska; and Cunard reduced (in 2017 and further in 2018) the number of visits by its ships. As a result, the <this city> Port Authority estimated an 11.4 per cent drop in cruise ships arriving in 2017 versus 2016, leading to a similar reduction in income for <this city>.\nHaving failed in its 2013 bid to ban oversized cruise ships from the Giudecca Canal, the city switched to a new strategy in mid-2017, banning the creation of any additional hotels. Currently, there are over 24,000 hotel rooms. The ban does not affect short-term rentals in the historic centre which are causing an increase in the cost of living for the native residents of <this city>. The city had already banned any additional fast food \"take-away\" outlets, to retain the historic character of the city, which was another reason for freezing the number of hotel rooms. Fewer than half of the millions of annual visitors stay overnight, however.The city also considered a ban on wheeled suitcases, but settled for banning hard plastic wheels for transporting cargo from May 2015.In addition to accelerating erosion of the ancient city's foundations and creating some pollution in the lagoon, cruise ships dropping an excessive number of day trippers can make St. Marks Square and other popular attractions too crowded to walk through during the peak season. Government officials see little value to the economy from the \"eat and flee\" tourists who stay for less than a day, which is typical of those from cruise ships.Some locals continued to aggressively lobby for new methods that would reduce the number of cruise ship passengers; their estimate indicated that there are up to 30,000 such sightseers per day at peak periods, while others concentrate their effort on promoting a more responsible way of visiting the city. An unofficial referendum to ban large cruise ships was held in June 2017. More than 18,000 people voted at 60 polling booths set up by activists, and 17,874 favored banning large ships from the lagoon. The population of <this city> at the time was about 50,000. The organizers of the referendum backed a plan to build a new cruise ship terminal at one of the three entrances to the Venetian Lagoon. Passengers would be transferred to the historic area in smaller boats.On 28 February 2019, the <this city> City Council voted in favour of a new municipal regulation requiring day-trippers visiting the historic centre, and the islands in the lagoon, to pay a new access fee. The extra revenue from the fee would be used for cleaning, maintaining security, reducing the financial burden on residents of <this city>, and to \"allow Venetians to live with more decorum\". The new tax would be between \u20ac3 and \u20ac10 per person, depending on the expected tourist flow into the old city. The fee could be waived for certain types of travelers: including students, children under the age of 6, voluntary workers, residents of the Veneto region, and participants in sporting events. Overnight visitors, who already pay a \"stay\" tax and account for around 40% of <this city>'s yearly total of 28 million visitors, would also be exempted. The access fee was expected to come into effect in September 2019; but it was postponed, firstly, until 1 January 2020, and then, again, due to the coronavirus pandemic. The new charges would be imposed on those tourists who were not staying overnight and is expected to come into force on 1 April 2024.\n\nDiverting cruise ships\nHaving failed in its 2013 bid to ban oversized cruise ships from the Giudecca Canal, the Italian inter-ministerial Comitatone overseeing <this city>'s lagoon released an official directive in November 2017 to keep the largest cruise ships away from the Piazza San Marco and the entrance to the Grand Canal. Ships over 55,000 tons will be required to follow a specific route through the Vittorio Emmanuele III Canal to reach Marghera, an industrial area of the mainland, where a passenger terminal would be built.\nIn 2014, the United Nations warned the city that it may be placed on UNESCO's List of World Heritage in Danger sites unless cruise ships are banned from the canals near the historic centre.According to the officials, the plan to create an alternative route for ships would require extensive dredging of the canal and the building of a new port, which would take four years, in total, to complete. However, the activist group No Grandi Navi (No big Ships), argued that the effects of pollution caused by the ships would not be diminished by the re-routing plan.On 2 June 2019, the cruise ship MSC Opera rammed a tourist riverboat, the River Countess, which was docked on the Giudecca Canal, injuring five people, in addition to causing property damage. The incident immediately led to renewed demands to ban large cruise ships from the Giudecca Canal, including a Twitter message to that effect posted by the environment minister. The city's mayor urged authorities to accelerate the steps required for cruise ships to begin using the alternate Vittorio Emanuele canal. <this country>'s transport minister spoke of a \"solution to protect both the lagoon and tourism ... after many years of inertia\" but specifics were not reported. As of June 2019, the 2017 plan to establish an alternative route for large ships, preventing them from coming near the historic area of the city, has not yet been approved.Nonetheless, the Italian government released an announcement on 7 August 2019 that it would begin rerouting cruise ships larger than 1000 tonnes away from the historic city's Giudecca Canal. For the last four months of 2019, all heavy vessels will dock at the Fusina and Lombardia terminals which are still on the lagoon but away from the central islands. By 2020, one-third of all cruise ships will be rerouted, according to Danilo Toninelli, the minister for <this city>. Preparation work for the Vittorio Emanuele Canal needed to begin soon for a long-term solution, according to the Cruise Lines International Association. In the long-term, space for ships would be provided at new terminals, perhaps at Chioggia or Lido San Nicolo. That plan was not imminent however, since public consultations had not yet begun. Over 1.5 million people per year arrive in <this city> on cruise ships. The Italian government decided to divert large cruise ships beginning August 2021.\n\nTransport\nIn the historic centre\n<this city> is built on an archipelago of 118 islands in a shallow, 550 km2 (212 sq mi) lagoon, connected by 400 bridges over 177 canals. In the 19th century, a causeway to the mainland brought the railroad to <this city>. The adjoining Ponte della Libert\u00e0 road causeway and terminal parking facilities in Tronchetto island and Piazzale Roma were built during the 20th century. Beyond these rail and road terminals on the northern edge of the city, transportation within the city's historic centre remains, as it was in centuries past, entirely on water or on foot. <this city> is Europe's largest urban car-free area and is unique in Europe in having remained a sizable functioning city in the 21st century entirely without motorcars or trucks.\nThe classic Venetian boat is the gondola, (plural: gondole) although it is now mostly used for tourists, or for weddings, funerals, or other ceremonies, or as traghetti (sing.: traghetto) to cross the Grand Canal in lieu of a nearby bridge. The traghetti are operated by two oarsmen.There are approximately 400 licensed gondoliers in <this city>, in their distinctive livery, and a similar number of boats, down from 10,000 two centuries ago. Many gondolas are lushly appointed with crushed velvet seats and Persian rugs. At the front of each gondola that works in the city, there is a large piece of metal called the f\u00e8ro (iron). Its shape has evolved through the centuries, as documented in many well-known paintings. Its form, topped by a likeness of the Doge's hat, became gradually standardized, and was then fixed by local law. It consists of six bars pointing forward representing the sestieri of the city, and one that points backwards representing the Giudecca. A lesser-known boat is the smaller, simpler, but similar, sandolo.\n\nWaterways\n<this city>'s small islands were enhanced during the Middle Ages by the dredging of soil to raise the marshy ground above the tides. The resulting canals encouraged the flourishing of a nautical culture which proved central to the economy of the city. Today those canals still provide the means for transport of goods and people within the city.\nThe maze of canals threading through the city requires more than 400 bridges to permit the flow of foot traffic. In 2011, the city opened the Ponte della Costituzione, the fourth bridge across the Grand Canal, which connects the Piazzale Roma bus-terminal area with the Venezia Santa Lucia railway station. The other bridges are the original Ponte di Rialto, the Ponte dell'Accademia, and the Ponte degli Scalzi.\n\nPublic transport\nAzienda del Consorzio Trasporti Veneziano (ACTV) is a public company responsible for public transportation in <this city>.\n\nLagoon area\nThe main means of public transportation consists of motorised waterbuses (vaporetti) which ply regular routes along the Grand Canal and between the city's islands. Private motorised water taxis are also active. The only gondole still in common use by Venetians are the traghetti, foot passenger ferries crossing the Grand Canal at certain points where there are no convenient bridges. Other gondole are rented by tourists on an hourly basis.The <this city> People Mover is an elevated shuttle train public transit system connecting Tronchetto island with its car parking facility with Piazzale Roma where visitors arrive in the city by bus, taxi, or automobile. The train makes a stop at the Marittima cruise terminal at the Port of <this city>.\n\nLido and Pellestrina islands\nLido and Pellestrina are two islands forming a barrier between the southern Venetian Lagoon and the Adriatic Sea. On those islands, road traffic, including bus service, is allowed. Vaporetti link them with other islands (<this city>, Murano, Burano) and with the peninsula of Cavallino-Treporti.\n\nMainland\nThe mainland of <this city> is composed of 5 boroughs: Mestre-Carpenedo, Marghera, Chirignago-Zelarino, and Favaro Veneto. Mestre is the centre and the most populous urban area of the mainland. There are several bus routes and two Translohr tramway lines. Several bus routes and one of the tramway lines link the mainland with Piazzale Roma, the main bus station in <this city>, via Ponte della Libert\u00e0, the road bridge connecting the mainland with the group of islands that comprise the historic centre of <this city>.\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in <this city>, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 52 min. Only 12.2% of public transit riders ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 10 min, while 17.6% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 7 kilometres (4.3 mi), while 12% travel for over 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) in a single direction.\n\nRail\n<this city> is serviced by regional and national trains, including trains to Florence (1h53), Milan (2h13), Turin (3h10), Rome (3h33), and Naples (4h50). In addition there are international day trains to Zurich, Innsbruck, Munich, and Vienna, plus overnight sleeper services, to Paris and Dijon on Thello trains, and to Munich and Vienna via \u00d6BB.\n\nThe Venezia Santa Lucia railway station is a few steps away from a vaporetti stop, Ferovia, in the historic city next to the Piazzale Roma. This station is the terminus of local trains and of the luxury <this city> Simplon Orient Express from London via Paris and other cities.\nThe Venezia Mestre railway station is on the mainland, on the border between the boroughs of Mestre and Marghera.Both stations are managed by Grandi Stazioni; they are linked by the Ponte della Libert\u00e0 (Liberty Bridge) between the mainland and the city centre.\nOther stations in the municipality are Venezia Porto Marghera, Venezia Carpenedo, Venezia Mestre Ospedale, and Venezia Mestre Porta Ovest.\n\nPorts\nThe Port of <this city> (Italian: Porto di Venezia) is the eighth-busiest commercial port in <this country> and was a major hub for the cruise sector in the Mediterranean, as since August 2021 ships of more 25,000 tons are forbidden to pass the Giudecca Canal. It is one of the major Italian ports and is included in the list of the leading European ports which are located on the strategic nodes of trans-European networks. In 2002, the port handled 262,337 containers. In 2006, 30,936,931 tonnes passed through the port, of which 14,541,961 was commercial traffic, and saw 1,453,513 passengers.\n\nAviation\nThe Marco Polo International Airport (Aeroporto di Venezia Marco Polo) is named in honor of Marco Polo. The airport is on the mainland and was rebuilt away from the coast. Public transport from the airport takes one to:\n\n<this city> Piazzale Roma by ATVO (provincial company) buses and by ACTV (city company) buses (route 5 aerobus);\n<this city>, Lido, and Murano by Allilaguna (private company) motor boats;\nMestre, the mainland, where <this city> Mestre railway station is convenient for connections to Milan, Padua, Trieste, Verona and the rest of <this country>, and for ACTV (routes 15 and 45) and ATVO buses and other transport;\nRegional destinations, such as Treviso and Padua, by ATVO and Busitalia Sita Nord buses.<this city>-Treviso Airport, about 30 kilometres (19 mi) from <this city>, is used mainly by low-cost airlines. There are public buses from this airport to <this city>.\nVenezia-Lido \"Giovanni Nicelli\", a public airport suitable for smaller aircraft, is at the northeast end of Lido di Venezia. It has a 994-metre (3,261 ft) grass runway.\n\nSport\nThe most famous Venetian sport is probably Voga alla Veneta (\"Venetian-style rowing\"), also commonly called voga veneta. A technique invented in the Venetian Lagoon, Venetian rowing is unusual in that the rower(s), one or more, row standing, looking forward. Today, Voga alla Veneta is not only the way the gondoliers row tourists around <this city> but also the way Venetians row for pleasure and sport. Many races called regata(e) happen throughout the year. The culminating event of the rowing season is the day of the \"Regata Storica\", which occurs on the first Sunday of September each year.The main football club in the city is Venezia F.C., founded in 1907, which currently plays in the Serie B. Their ground, the Stadio Pier Luigi Penzo, situated in Sant'Elena, is the second-oldest continually used stadium in <this country>.\nThe local basketball club is Reyer Venezia, founded in 1872 as the gymnastics club Societ\u00e0 Sportiva Costantino Reyer, and in 1907 as the basketball club. Reyer currently plays in the Lega Basket Serie A. The men's team were the Italian champions in 1942, 1943, and 2017. Their arena is the Palasport Giuseppe Taliercio, situated in Mestre. Luigi Brugnaro is both the president of the club and the mayor of the city.\n\nEducation\n<this city> is a major international centre for higher education. The city hosts the Ca' Foscari University of <this city>, founded in 1868; the Universit\u00e0 Iuav di Venezia, founded in 1926; the <this city> International University, founded in 1995 and located on the island of San Servolo and the EIUC-European Inter-University Centre for Human Rights and Democratisation, located on the island of Lido di Venezia.Other Venetian institutions of higher education are: the Accademia di Belle Arti (Academy of Fine Arts), established in 1750, whose first chairman was Giovanni Battista Piazzetta, and the Benedetto Marcello Conservatory of Music, which was first established in 1876 as a high school and musical society, later (1915) became Liceo Musicale, and then, when its director was Gian Francesco Malipiero, the State Conservatory of Music (1940).\n\nCulture\nLiterature\n<this city> has long been a source of inspiration for authors, playwrights, and poets, and at the forefront of the technological development of printing and publishing.\nTwo of the most noted Venetian writers were Marco Polo in the Middle Ages and, later, Giacomo Casanova. Polo (1254\u20131324) was a merchant who voyaged to the Orient. His series of books, co-written with Rustichello da Pisa and titled Il Milione provided important knowledge of the lands east of Europe, from the Middle East to China, Japan, and Russia. Giacomo Casanova (1725\u20131798) was a prolific writer and adventurer best remembered for his autobiography, Histoire De Ma Vie (Story of My Life), which links his colourful lifestyle to the city of <this city>.\n\nVenetian playwrights followed the old Italian theatre tradition of Commedia dell'arte. Ruzante (1502\u20131542), Carlo Goldoni (1707\u20131793), and Carlo Gozzi (1720\u20131806) used the Venetian dialect extensively in their comedies.\n<this city> has also inspired writers from abroad. Shakespeare set Othello and The Merchant of <this city> in the city, as did Thomas Mann his novel, Death in <this city> (1912). The French writer Philippe Sollers spent most of his life in <this city> and published A Dictionary For Lovers of <this city> in 2004.\nThe city features prominently in Henry James's The Aspern Papers and The Wings of the Dove. It is also visited in Evelyn Waugh's Brideshead Revisited and Marcel Proust's In Search of Lost Time. Perhaps the best-known children's book set in <this city> is The Thief Lord, written by the German author Cornelia Funke.\nThe poet Ugo Foscolo (1778\u20131827), born in Zante, an island that at the time belonged to the Republic of <this city>, was also a revolutionary who wanted to see a free republic established in <this city> following its fall to Napoleon.\n<this city> also inspired the poetry of Ezra Pound, who wrote his first literary work in the city. Pound died in 1972, and his remains are buried in <this city>'s cemetery island of San Michele.\n<this city> is also linked to the technological aspects of writing. The city was the location of one of <this country>'s earliest printing presses called Aldine Press, established by Aldus Manutius in 1494. From this beginning <this city> developed as an important typographic centre. Around fifteen percent of all printing of the fifteenth century came from <this city>, and even as late as the 18th century was responsible for printing half of <this country>'s published books.\n\nIn literature and adapted works\nThe city is a particularly popular setting for essays, novels, and other works of fictional or non-fictional literature. Examples of these include:\n\nAretino's works (1492-1556)\nShakespeare's Merchant of <this city> (c.\u20091596\u20131598) and Othello (1603).\nBen Jonson's Volpone (1605\u20136).\nCasanova's autobiographical History of My Life c.\u20091789\u20131797.\nVoltaire's Candide (1759).\nLetitia Elizabeth Landon wrote poetry for two pictures of <this city>; one for The Embarkation, drawn by Clarkson Stanfield for The Amulet, 1833, the other for Santa Salute, drawn by Charles Bentley for the Literary Souvenir, 1835.\nErnest Hemingway's Across the River and into the Trees (1950).\nItalo Calvino's Invisible Cities (1972).\nAnne Rice's Cry to Heaven (1982).\nDonna Leon's Commissario Guido Brunetti crime fiction series and cookbook, and the German television series based on the novels (1992\u20132019).\nPhilippe Sollers' Watteau in <this city> (1994).\nMichael Dibdin's Dead Lagoon (1994), one in a series of novels featuring <this city>-born policeman Aurelio Zen.\nJacqueline Carey's Kushiel's Chosen (2002), an historical fantasy or alternate history of <this city>\u2014complete with masquerades, canals, and a doge\u2014taking place in a city known as La Serenissima.\nJohn Berendt's The City of Falling Angels (2005)Additionally, Thomas Mann's novella, Death in <this city> (1912), was the basis for Benjamin Britten's eponymous opera (1973).\n\nForeign words of Venetian origin\nSome words with a Venetian etymology include arsenal, ciao, ghetto, gondola, imbroglio, lagoon, lazaret, lido, Montenegro, and regatta.\n\nPrinting\nBy the end of the 15th century, <this city> had become the European capital of printing, having 417 printers by 1500, and being one of the first cities in <this country> (after Subiaco and Rome) to have a printing press, after those established in Germany. The most important printing office was the Aldine Press of Aldus Manutius; which in 1497 issued the first printed work of Aristotle; in 1499 printed the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili, considered the most beautiful book of the Renaissance; and established modern punctuation, page format, and italic type.\n\nPainting\n<this city>, especially during the Renaissance, and Baroque periods, was a major centre of art and developed a unique style known as the Venetian painting. In the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, <this city>, along with Florence and Rome, became one of the most important centres of art in Europe, and numerous wealthy Venetians became patrons of the arts. <this city> at the time was a rich and prosperous Maritime Republic, which controlled a vast sea and trade empire.In the 16th century, Venetian painting was developed through influences from the Paduan School and Antonello da Messina, who introduced the oil painting technique of the Van Eyck brothers. It is signified by a warm colour scale and a picturesque use of colour. Early masters were the Bellini and Vivarini families, followed by Giorgione and Titian, then Tintoretto and Veronese. In the early 16th century, there was rivalry in Venetian painting between the disegno and colorito techniques.Canvases (the common painting surface) originated in <this city> during the early Renaissance. In the 18th century, Venetian painting had a revival with Tiepolo's decorative painting and Canaletto's and Guardi's panoramic views.\n\nVenetian architecture\n<this city> is built on unstable mud-banks, and had a very crowded city centre by the Middle Ages. On the other hand, the city was largely safe from riot, civil feuds, and invasion much earlier than most European cities. These factors, with the canals and the great wealth of the city, made for unique building styles.\n<this city> has a rich and diverse architectural style, the most prominent of which is the Gothic style. Venetian Gothic architecture is a term given to a Venetian building style combining the use of the Gothic lancet arch with the curved ogee arch, due to Byzantine and Ottoman influences. The style originated in 14th-century <this city>, with a confluence of Byzantine style from Constantinople, Islamic influences from Spain and <this city>'s eastern trading partners, and early Gothic forms from mainland <this country>. Chief examples of the style are the Doge's Palace and the Ca' d'Oro in the city. The city also has several Renaissance and Baroque buildings, including the Ca' Pesaro and the Ca' Rezzonico.\nVenetian taste was conservative and Renaissance architecture only really became popular in buildings from about the 1470s. More than in the rest of <this country>, it kept much of the typical form of the Gothic palazzi, which had evolved to suit Venetian conditions. In turn the transition to Baroque architecture was also fairly gentle. This gives the crowded buildings on the Grand Canal and elsewhere an essential harmony, even where buildings from very different periods sit together. For example, round-topped arches are far more common in Renaissance buildings than elsewhere.\n\nRococo style\nIt can be argued that <this city> produced the best and most refined Rococo designs. At the time, the Venetian economy was in decline. It had lost most of its maritime power, was lagging behind its rivals in political importance, and its society had become decadent, with tourism increasingly the mainstay of the economy. But <this city> remained a centre of fashion. Venetian rococo was well known as rich and luxurious, with usually very extravagant designs. Unique Venetian furniture types included the divani da portego, and long rococo couches and pozzetti, objects meant to be placed against the wall. Bedrooms of rich Venetians were usually sumptuous and grand, with rich damask, velvet, and silk drapery and curtains, and beautifully carved rococo beds with statues of putti, flowers, and angels. <this city> was especially known for its girandole mirrors, which remained among, if not the, finest in Europe. Chandeliers were usually very colourful, using Murano glass to make them look more vibrant and stand out from others; and precious stones and materials from abroad were used, since <this city> still held a vast trade empire. Lacquer was very common, and many items of furniture were covered with it, the most noted being lacca povera (poor lacquer), in which allegories and images of social life were painted. Lacquerwork and Chinoiserie were particularly common in bureau cabinets.\n\nGlass\n<this city> is known for its ornate glass-work, known as Venetian glass, which is world-renowned for being colourful, elaborate, and skilfully made. Many of the important characteristics of these objects had been developed by the 13th century. Toward the end of that century, the centre of the Venetian glass industry moved to Murano, an offshore island in <this city>. The glass made there is known as Murano glass.\n\nByzantine craftsmen played an important role in the development of Venetian glass. When Constantinople was sacked in the Fourth Crusade in 1204, some fleeing artisans came to <this city>; when the Ottomans took Constantinople in 1453, still more glassworkers arrived. By the 16th century, Venetian artisans had gained even greater control over the colour and transparency of their glass, and had mastered a variety of decorative techniques. Despite efforts to keep Venetian glassmaking techniques within <this city>, they became known elsewhere, and Venetian-style glassware was produced in other Italian cities and other countries of Europe.\nSome of the most important brands of glass in the world today are still produced in the historical glass factories on Murano. They are: Venini, Barovier & Toso, Pauly, Millevetri, and Seguso. Barovier & Toso is considered one of the 100 oldest companies in the world, formed in 1295.\nIn February 2021, the world learned that Venetian glass trade beads had been found at three prehistoric Inuit sites in Alaska, including Punyik Point. Uninhabited today, and located 1 mile (1.6 km) from the Continental Divide in the Brooks Range, the area was on ancient trade routes from the Bering Sea to the Arctic Ocean. From their creation in <this city>, researchers believe the likely route these artifacts traveled was across Europe, then Eurasia and finally over the Bering Strait, making this discovery \"the first documented instance of the presence of indubitable European materials in prehistoric sites in the western hemisphere as the result of overland transport across the Eurasian continent.\" After radiocarbon dating materials found near the beads, archaeologists estimated their arrival on the continent to sometime between 1440 and 1480, predating Christopher Columbus.

The Venetian state \u2013 i.e., the medieval Republic of <this city> \u2013 was often popularly called the \"Republic of Music\", and an anonymous Frenchman of the 17th century is said to have remarked that \"In every home, someone is playing a musical instrument or singing. There is music everywhere.\"During the 16th century, <this city> became one of the most important musical centres of Europe, marked by a characteristic style of composition (the Venetian school) and the development of the Venetian polychoral style under composers such as Adrian Willaert, who worked at St Mark's Basilica. <this city> was the early centre of music printing; Ottaviano Petrucci began publishing music almost as soon as this technology was available, and his publishing enterprise helped to attract composers from all over Europe, especially from France and Flanders. By the end of the century, <this city> was known for the splendor of its music, as exemplified in the \"colossal style\" of Andrea and Giovanni Gabrieli, which used multiple choruses and instrumental groups. <this city> was also the home of many noted composers during the baroque period, such as Antonio Vivaldi, Ippolito Ciera, Giovanni Picchi, and Girolamo Dalla Casa, to name but a few.\n\nOrchestras\n<this city> is the home of numerous orchestras such as, the Orchestra della Fenice, Rond\u00f2 Veneziano, Interpreti Veneziani, and <this city> Baroque Orchestra.\n\nCinema, media, and popular culture\nThe city has been the setting or chosen location of numerous films, games, works of fine art and literature (including essays, fiction, non-fiction, and poems), music videos, television shows, and other cultural references.\n\nPhotography\nFulvio Roiter was the pioneer in artistic photography in <this city>, followed by a number of photographers whose works are often reproduced on postcards, thus reaching a widest international popular exposure.

These include sarde in sa\u00f3r (sardines marinated to preserve them for long voyages); bacal\u00e0 mantecato (a recipe based on Norwegian stockfish and extra-virgin olive oil); bis\u00e0to (marinated eel); risi e bisi \u2013 rice, peas and (unsmoked) bacon; fegato alla veneziana, Venetian-style veal liver; ris\u00f2to col n\u00e9ro de s\u00e9pe (risotto with cuttlefish, blackened by their own ink); cich\u00e9ti, refined and delicious tidbits (akin to tapas); antipasti (appetizers); and prosecco, an effervescent, mildly sweet wine.\nIn addition, <this city> is known for the golden, oval-shaped cookies called ba\u00eccoli, and for other types of sweets, such as: pan del pesca\u00f3r (bread of the fisherman); cookies with almonds and pistachio nuts; cookies with fried Venetian cream, or the bussol\u00e0i (butter biscuits and shortbread made in the shape of a ring or an \"S\") from the island of Burano; the gal\u00e0ni or cr\u00f3stoli (angel wings); the fr\u00ectole (fried spherical doughnuts); the fregol\u00f2tta (a crumbly cake with almonds); a milk pudding called ros\u00e0da; and cookies called zal\u00e9ti, whose ingredients include yellow maize flour.The dessert tiramis\u00f9 is generally thought to have been invented in Treviso in the 1970s, and is popular in the Veneto area.\n\nFashion and shopping\nIn the 14th century, many young Venetian men began wearing tight-fitting multicoloured hose, the designs on which indicated the Compagnie della Calza (\"Trouser Club\") to which they belonged. The Venetian Senate passed sumptuary laws, but these merely resulted in changes in fashion in order to circumvent the law. Dull garments were worn over colourful ones, which then were cut to show the hidden colours resulting in the spread of men's \"slashed\" fashions in the 15th century.Today, <this city> is a major fashion and shopping centre; not as important as Milan, Florence, and Rome, but on a par with Verona, Turin, Vicenza, Naples, and Genoa.
