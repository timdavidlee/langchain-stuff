  "wiki_text": "<this city> ( gr\u0259-NAH-d\u0259; Spanish: [\u0261\u027ea\u02c8na\u00f0a], locally [\u0261\u027ea\u02c8na]) is the capital city of the province of <this city>, in the autonomous community of Andalusia, <this country>. <this city> is located at the foot of the Sierra Nevada mountains, at the confluence of four rivers, the Darro, the Genil, the Monachil and the Beiro. Ascribed to the Vega de <this city> comarca, the city sits at an average elevation of 738 m (2,421 ft) above sea level, yet is only one hour by car from the Mediterranean coast, the Costa Tropical. Nearby is the Sierra Nevada Ski Station, where the FIS Alpine World Ski Championships 1996 were held.\nIn the 2021 national census, the population of the city of <this city> proper was 227,383, and the population of the entire municipal area was estimated to be 231,775, ranking as the 20th-largest urban area of <this country>. About 3.3% of the population did not hold Spanish citizenship, the largest number of these people (31%; or 1% of the total population) coming from South America. Its nearest airport is Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca <this city>-Ja\u00e9n Airport.\nThe area was settled since ancient times by Iberians, Romans, and Visigoths. The current settlement became a major city of Al-Andalus in the 11th century during the Zirid Taifa of <this city>. In the 13th century it became the capital of the Emirate of <this city> under Nasrid rule, the last Muslim-ruled state in the Iberian Peninsula. <this city> was conquered in 1492 by the Catholic Monarchs and progressively transformed into a Christian city over the course of the 16th century.The Alhambra, a medieval Nasrid citadel and palace, is located in <this city>. It is one of the most famous monuments of Islamic architecture and one of the most visited tourist sites in <this country>. Islamic-period influence and Moorish architecture are also preserved in the Albaic\u00edn neighborhood and other medieval monuments in the city. The 16th century also saw a flourishing of Mud\u00e9jar architecture and Renaissance architecture, followed later by Baroque and Churrigueresque styles. The University of <this city> has an estimated 47,000 undergraduate students spread over five different campuses in the city. The pomegranate (in Spanish, granada) is the heraldic device of <this city>.\n\nEtymology\n<this city>'s historical name in the Arabic language was \u063a\u0631\u0646\u0627\u0637\u0629 (\u0120arn\u0101\u1e6da). Both the name's meaning and origin are uncertain and have been debated. The toponym definitely existed prior to the Zirid period in the 11th century. It probably first appeared in the 9th century and it is found in Arabic sources from the 10th century.The word G\u00e1rnata (or Karnata) possibly meant \"hill of strangers\".:\u200a41\u200a Another meaning might be \"hill of pilgrims\". It could even have been of Berber origin. Another theory is that it derived from Latin granum (or its plural grana), meaning \"seed\", \"beads\", or a \"scarlet color\", which would have been adapted into Arabic as \u0120arn\u0101\u1e6da or I\u0121ran\u0101\u1e6da. The Arab chronicler Al-Maqqari believed that it came from the Latin word for pomegranate, granata. In either case, the Latin word may have been used not in its primary sense, but in the more derived sense of \"red\", referring to the color of the area's soil and its buildings. This would also mirror the etymology of the name of the Alhambra.\n\nHistory\nPre-Umayyad history\nThe region surrounding what today is <this city> has been populated since at least 5500 BC. Archeological artifacts found in the city indicate that the site of the city, including the area around the present-day avenue of Gran V\u00eda de Col\u00f3n, was inhabited since the Bronze Age. The most ancient ruins found in the area belong to an oppidum called Ilturir, founded by the Iberian Bastetani tribe around 650 BC. The name Elibyrge is also attested in reference to this area. This settlement became later known as Iliberri or Iliberis. In 44 BC Iliberis became a Roman colony and in 27 BC it became a Roman municipium named Florentia Iliberritana ('Flourishing Iliberri').The identification of present-day <this city> with the Roman-era Iliberis and the historical continuity between the two settlements has long been debated by scholars. Modern archeological digs on the Albaic\u00edn hill have uncovered finds demonstrating the presence of a significant Roman town on that site. Little is known, however, about the history of the city in the period between the end of the Roman era and the 11th century. An important Christian synod circa 300 AD, the Synod of Elvira, took place near this area (the name Elvira being derived from the name Iliberri), but there is no concrete archeological or documentary evidence establishing the exact location of the meeting. It may have taken place in the former Roman town or it may have taken place somewhere in the surrounding region, which was known as Elvira.\n\nFounding and early history\nThe Umayyad conquest of Hispania, starting in 711 AD, brought large parts of the Iberian Peninsula under Moorish control and established al-Andalus. The earliest Arabic historical sources mention that a town named Qasht\u012bliya, later known as Mad\u012bnat Ilb\u012bra (Elvira), was located on the southern slopes of the Sierra de Elvira mountains (near present-day Atarfe) and became the most important settlement in the area. A smaller settlement and fortress (\u1e25i\u1e63n) named \u0120arn\u0101\u1e6da (also transliterated as Gharn\u0101\u1e6da) existed on the south side of the Darro River or on the site of the current Albaic\u00edn neighbourhood. The latter had a mainly Jewish population and thus was also known as Gharn\u0101\u1e6dat al-Yah\u016bd (\"Gharn\u0101\u1e6da of the Jews\"). The district around the city was known as K\u016brat Ilb\u012bra (roughly \"Province of Elvira\"). After 743 the town of Ilb\u012bra was settled by soldiers from the region of Syria who played a role in supporting Abd al-Rahman I, the founder of the Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba and a new Umayyad dynasty. In the late 9th century, during the reign of Abdallah (r. 844\u2013912), the city and its surrounding district were the site of conflict between muwallads (Muslim converts) who were loyal to the central government and Arabs, led by Saww\u0101r ibn \u1e24amd\u016bn, who resented them.At the beginning of the 11th century, the area became dominated by the Zirids, a Sanhaja Berber group and offshoot of the Zirids who ruled parts of North Africa. This group became an important contingent in the army of \u02bfAbd al-Malik al-Mu\u1e93affar, the prime minister of Caliph Hisham II (r. 976\u20131009) and successor to Ibn Abi \u02bfAmir al-Mansur (Almanzor) as de facto ruler of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba. For their service, the Zirids were granted control of the province of Elvira. When the Caliphate collapsed after 1009 and the Fitna (civil war) began, the Zirid leader Zawi ben Ziri established an independent kingdom for himself, the Taifa of <this city>. Arab sources such as al-Idrisi consider him to be the founder of the city of <this city>. His surviving memoirs \u2013 the only ones for the Spanish \"Middle Ages\" \u2013 provide considerable detail for this brief period. Because Mad\u012bnat Ilb\u012bra was situated on a low plain and, as a result, difficult to protect from attacks, the ruler decided to transfer his residence to the higher situated area of \u0120arn\u0101\u1e6da. According to Arabic sources Ilb\u012bra was razed during the Fitna, afterwards it was not restored at its previous place and instead \u0120arn\u0101\u1e6da, the former Jewish town, replaced it as the main city. In a short time this town was transformed into one of the most important cities of al-Andalus. Until the 11th century it had a mixed population of Christians, Muslims, and Jews.\nThe Zirids built their citadel and palace, known as the al-Qa\u1e63aba al-Qad\u012bma (\"Old Citadel\"), on the hill now occupied by the Albaic\u00edn neighborhood. It was connected to two smaller fortresses on the Sabika hill (site of the future Alhambra) and Mauror hill to the south. The city around it grew during the 11th century to include the Albaic\u00edn, the Sabika, the Mauror, and a part of the surrounding plains. The city was fortified with walls encompassing an area of approximately 75 hectares. The northern part of these walls, near the Albaicin citadel, have survived to the present day, along with two of its gates: B\u0101b al-Unaydar (now called Puerta Monaita in Spanish) and B\u0101b al-Ziy\u0101da (now known as Arco de las Pesas or Puerta Nueva). The city and its residences were supplied with water through an extensive network of underground cisterns and pipes. On the Darro River, along the wall connecting the Zirid citadel with the Sabika hill, was a sluice gate called B\u0101b al-Dif\u0101f (\"Gate of the Tambourines\"), which could be closed or opened to control the flow of the river and retain water if necessary. The nearby Ba\u00f1uelo, a former hammam (bathhouse), also likely dates from this time, as does the former minaret of a mosque in the Albaic\u00edn, now part of the Church of San Jos\u00e9.Under the Zirid kings Habbus ibn Maksan and Badis, the most powerful figure was the Jewish administrator known as Samuel ha-Nagid (in Hebrew) or Isma'il ibn Nagrilla (in Arabic). Samuel was a highly educated member of the former elites of Cordoba, who fled that city after the outbreak of the Fitna. He eventually found his way to <this city>, where Habbus ibn Maksan appointed him his secretary in 1020 and entrusted him with many important responsibilities, including tax collection. Under Badis, he even took charge of the army. During this period, the Muslim king was looked upon as a mainly symbolic figurehead. <this city> was the center of Jewish Sephardi culture and scholarship. According to Daniel Eisenberg:\n\n<this city> was in the eleventh century the center of Sephardic civilization at its peak, and from 1027 until 1066 <this city> was a powerful Jewish state. Jews did not hold the foreigner (dhimmi) status typical of Islamic rule. Samuel ibn Nagrilla, recognized by Sephardic Jews everywhere as the quasi-political ha-Nagid ('The Prince'), was king in all but name. As vizier he made policy and\u2014much more unusual\u2014led the army. [...] It is said that Samuel's strengthening and fortification of <this city> was what permitted it, later, to survive as the last Islamic state in the Iberian peninsula. All of the greatest figures of eleventh-century Hispano-Jewish culture are associated with <this city>. Moses Ibn Ezra was from <this city>; on his invitation Judah ha-Levi spent several years there as his guest. Ibn Gabirol\u2019s patrons and hosts were the Jewish viziers of <this city>, Samuel ha-Nagid and his son Joseph.\nAfter Samuel's death, his son Joseph took over after his position but proved to lack his father's diplomacy, bringing on the 1066 <this city> massacre, which ended the Golden age of Jewish culture in <this country>.From the late 11th century to the early 13th century, Al-Andalus was dominated by two successive North African Berber empires. The Almoravids ruled <this city> from 1090 and the Almohads from 1166. Evidence from the artistic and archeological remains of this period suggest that the city thrived under the Almoravids but declined under the Almohads. Remnants of the Almohad period in the city include the Alc\u00e1zar Genil, built in 1218\u20131219 (but later redecorated under the Nasrids), and possibly the former minaret attached to the present-day Church of San Juan de los Reyes in the Albaicin.\n\nNasrid Emirate of <this city>\nIn 1228 Idris al-Ma'mun, the last effective Almohad ruler in al-Andalus, left the Iberian Peninsula. As Almohad rule collapsed local leaders and factions emerged across the region. With the Reconquista in full swing, the Christian kingdoms of Castile and Aragon \u2013 under kings Ferdinand III and James I, respectively \u2013 made major conquests across al-Andalus. Castile captured Cordoba in 1236 and Seville in 1248. Meanwhile, the ambitious Ibn al-Ahmar (Muhammad I) established what became the last and longest reigning Muslim dynasty in the Iberian peninsula, the Nasrids, who ruled the Emirate of <this city>. On multiple occasions Ibn al-Ahmar aligned himself with Ferdinand III, eventually agreeing to become his vassal in 1246. <this city> thereafter became a tributary state to the Kingdom of Castile, although this was often interrupted by wars between the two states. The political history of the emirate was turbulent and intertwined with that of its neighbours. The Nasrids sometimes provided refuge or military aid to Castilian kings and noblemen, even against other Muslim states, while in turn the Castilians provided refuge and aid to some Nasrid emirs against other Nasrid rivals. On other occasions the Nasrids attempted to leverage the aid of the North African Marinids to ward off Castile, although Marinid interventions in the Peninsula ended after Battle of Rio Salado (1340).The population of the emirate was also swelled by Muslim refugees from the territories newly conquered by Castile and Aragon, resulting in a small yet densely-populated territory which was more uniformly Muslim and Arabic-speaking than before. The city itself expanded and new neighbourhoods grew around the Albaic\u00edn (named after refugees from Baeza) and in Antequeruela (named after refugees from Antequera after 1410). A new set of walls was constructed further north during the 13th\u201314th centuries, with Bab Ilbirah (present-day Puerta de Elvira) as its western entrance. A major Muslim cemetery existed outside this gate. The city's heart was its Great Mosque (on the site of the present-day <this city> Cathedral) and the commercial district known as the qaysariyya (the Alcaicer\u00eda). Next to this was the only major madrasa built in al-Andalus, the Madrasa al-Yusufiyya (known today as the Palacio de la Madraza), founded in 1349. Other monuments from this era include the al-Funduq al-Jadida (\"New Inn\" or caravanserai, now known as the Corral del Carb\u00f3n), built in the early 14th century, the Maristan (hospital), built in 1365\u20131367 and demolished in 1843, and the main mosque of the Albaic\u00edn, dating from the 13th century.\nWhen Ibn Al-Ahmar established himself in the city he moved the royal palace from the old Zirid citadel on the Albaic\u00edn hill to the Sabika hill, beginning construction on what became the present Alhambra. The Alhambra acted as a self-contained palace-city, with its own mosque, hammams, fortress, and residential quarters for workers and servants. The most celebrated palaces that survive today, such as the Comares Palace and the Palace of the Lions, generally date from the reigns of Yusuf I (r. 1333\u20131354) and his son Muhammad V (r. 1354\u20131391, with interruptions). Some smaller examples of Nasrid palace architecture in the city have survived in the Cuarto Real de Santo Domingo (late 13th century) and the Dar al-Horra (15th century).Partly due to the heavy tributary payments to Castile, <this city>'s economy specialized in the trade of high-value goods. Integrated within the European mercantile network, the ports of the kingdom fostered intense trading relations with the Genoese, but also with the Catalans, and to a lesser extent, with the Venetians, the Florentines, and the Portuguese. It provided connections with Muslim and Arab trade centers, particularly for gold from sub-Saharan Africa and the Maghreb, and exported silk and dried fruits produced in the area.Despite its frontier position, <this city> was also an important Islamic intellectual and cultural center, especially in the time of Muhammad V, with figures such as Ibn Khaldun and Ibn al-Khatib serving in the Nasrid court. Ibn Battuta, a famous traveller and historian, visited the Emirate of <this city> in 1350. He described it as a powerful and self-sufficient kingdom in its own right, although frequently embroiled in skirmishes with the Kingdom of Castile. In his journal, Ibn Battuta called <this city> the \"metropolis of Andalusia and the bride of its cities.\"\n\nEnd of Muslim rule and 16th-century changes\nOn 2 January 1492, the last Muslim ruler in Iberia, Emir Muhammad XII, known as \"Boabdil\" to the Spanish, surrendered complete control of the Emirate of <this city> to the Catholic Monarchs (Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile), after the last episode of the <this city> War.\nThe 1492 capitulation of the Kingdom of <this city> to the Catholic Monarchs is one of the most significant events in <this city>'s history. It brought the demise of the last Muslim-controlled polity in the Iberian Peninsula. The terms of the surrender, outlined in the Treaty of <this city> at the end of 1491, explicitly allowed the Muslim inhabitants, known as mud\u00e9jares, to continue unmolested in the practice of their faith and customs. This had been a traditional practice during Castilian (and Aragonese) conquests of Muslim cities since the takeover of Toledo in the 11th century. The terms of the surrender pressured Jewish inhabitants to convert or leave within three years, but this provision was quickly superseded by the Alhambra Decree, issued only a few months later on March 31, which instead forced all Jews in <this country> to convert or be expelled within four months. Those who converted became known as conversos (converts). This move, along with the progressive erosion of other guarantees provided by the surrender treaty, raised tensions and fears within the remaining Muslim community during the 1490s. Many of the city's affluent Muslims and its traditional ruling classes emigrated to North Africa in the early years after the conquest, but these early emigrants numbered only a few thousand, with the rest of the population unable to afford leaving.By 1499, Cardinal Francisco Jim\u00e9nez de Cisneros grew frustrated with the slow pace of the efforts of the first archbishop of <this city>, Hernando de Talavera, to convert non-Christians and undertook a program of forced baptisms, creating the converso class for Muslims and Jews. Cisneros's new strategy, which was a direct violation of the terms of the treaty, provoked the Rebellion of the Alpujarras (1499\u20131501) centered in the rural Alpujarras region southeast of the city. The rebellion lasted until 1500 in <this city> and continued until 1501 in the Alpujarras. Responding to the rebellion of 1501, the Crown of Castile rescinded the Treaty of <this city>, and mandated that <this city>'s Muslims convert or emigrate. Many of the remaining Muslim elites subsequently emigrated to North Africa. The majority of the <this city>'s mud\u00e9jares converted (becoming the so-called moriscos or Moorish) so that they could stay. Both populations of converts were subject to persecution, execution, or exile, and each had cells that practiced their original religion in secrecy (the so-called marranos in the case of the conversos accused of the charge of crypto-Judaism).\n\nOver the course of the 16th century, <this city> took on an ever more Catholic and Castilian character, as immigrants arrived from other regions of Castile, lured by the promise of economic opportunities in the newly conquered city. At the time of the city's surrender in 1492 it had a population of 50,000 which included only a handful of Christians (mostly captives), but by 1561 (the year of the first royal census of the city) the population was composed of over 30,000 Christian immigrants and approximately 15,000 moriscos. After 1492 the city's first churches had been installed in some converted mosques. The vast majority of the city's remaining mosques were subsequently converted into churches during and after the mass conversions of 1500. In 1531, Charles V founded the University of <this city> on the site of the former madrasa built by Yusuf I.<this city>'s Town Council did not fully establish until almost nine years after the Castilian conquest, upon the concession of the so-called 'Constitutive Charter' of the Ayuntamiento of <this city> on 23 September 1500. From then on, the municipal institution became a crucible for the \"Old Christian\" and the converted morisco elites, resulting in strong factionalism, particularly after 1508. The new period also saw the creation of a number of other new institutions such as the Cathedral Cabildo, the Captaincy\u2013General, the Royal Chapel and the Royal Chancellery. For the rest of the 16th century the <this city>n ruling oligarchy featured roughly a 40% of (Jewish) conversos and about a 31% of hidalgos. From the 1520s onward, the mosque structures themselves began to be replaced with new church buildings, a process which continued for most of the century. In December 1568, during a period of renewed persecution against moriscos, the Second Morisco Rebellion broke out in the Alpujarras. Although the city's morisco population played little role in the rebellion, King Philip II ordered the expulsion of the vast majority of the morisco population from the Kingdom of <this city>, with the exception of those artisans and professionals judged essential to the economy. The expelled population was redistributed to other cities throughout the Crown of Castile. The final expulsion of all moriscos from Castile and Aragon was carried out between 1609 and 1614.\n\nLater history and present day\nDuring the 17th century, despite the importance of immigration, the population of the city stagnated at about 55,000, contrary to the trend of population increase experienced in the rural areas of the Kingdom of <this city>, where the hammer of depopulation caused by the expulsion of the moriscos had taken a far greater toll in the previous century. The 17th-century demographic stagnation in the city and overall steady population increase in the wider kingdom went in line with the demographic disaster experienced throughout the century in the rest of the Crown of Castile. The city was overshadowed in importance by other cities including Seville and the capital, Madrid.Between 1810 and 1812 <this city> was occupied by Napoleon's army during the Peninsular War. The French troops occupied the Alhambra as a fortified position and caused significant damage to the monument. Upon evacuating the city, they attempted to dynamite the whole complex, successfully blowing up eight towers before the remaining fuses were disabled by Spanish soldier Jos\u00e9 Garcia, thus saving what remains today. In 1830 Washington Irving lived in <this city> and wrote his Tales of the Alhambra, which revived some international interest in southern <this country> and in its Islamic-era monuments.In the 1930s the tensions that eventually divided <this country> were evident in <this city>, with frequent riots and friction between landowners and peasants. When the Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936, <this city> was one of the cities that joined the Nationalist uprising. There was local resistance against the Nationalists, particularly from the working classes in the Albaic\u00edn, which was violently repressed. During the 1950s and 1960s, under the Franco regime, the province of <this city> was one of the poorest areas in <this country>. In recent decades tourism has become a major industry in the city.\n\nGeography\nLocation\nThe city of <this city> sits on the Vega de <this city>, one of the depressions or plains located within the Baetic mountain ranges, continued to the west by those of Archidona and Antequera and to the East by those of Guadix, Baza and Hu\u00e9scar.The fertile soil of the Vega, apt for agriculture, is irrigated by the water streams originated in Sierra Nevada, as well as minor secondary ranges, all drained by the catchment basin of the Genil River, that cuts across the city centre following an east to west direction. The Monachil, a left-bank tributary of the former, also passes through the city, discharging into the Genil to the west of the city centre.\n\nClimate\n<this city> has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Csa) close to a cold semi-arid climate (BSk) Summers are hot and dry with daily temperatures averaging 34 \u00b0C (93 \u00b0F) in the hottest month (July); however, temperatures reaching over 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F) are not uncommon in the summer months. Winters are cool and damp, with most of the rainfall concentrated from November through to January. The coldest month is January with daytime temperatures hovering at 13 \u00b0C (55 \u00b0F) and dropping to around 1 \u00b0C (34 \u00b0F) during the night. Frost is common as temperatures usually reach below-freezing in the early morning. Snow is rare and occurs once every few years. Spring and autumn are unpredictable, with temperatures ranging from mild to warm. Early summer in 2017 confronted the city with two massive heat waves that broke long-standing record temperatures starting on June 13, 2017, with a new maximum high for the month at 40.6 \u00b0C (old record 40.0), which was topped three times within the span of four days at 40.9 \u00b0C on June 14, 41.3 (June 15) and, eventually, 41.5 (June 17). The second extreme surge in temperatures followed roughly a month later when readings soared to 45.7 and 45.3 \u00b0C on July 12 and 13, respectively, surpassing the old July record by almost 3 degrees.\n\nDemographics\nUrban areas\nIn the municipality of <this city> there are five urban areas: <this city> city, Alquer\u00eda del Fargue, Bobadilla, Cerrillo de Maracena and Lancha del Genil. Due to the expansion of <this city> city, Cerrillo de Maracena has been integrated into it.\n\nPopulation pyramid\nAccording to the municipal register of inhabitants, in 2021 the municipality of <this city> had a population of 231,775 people, of whom 106,987 were men (46.15%) and 124,738 were women (53.85%). Since the 90's, there has been a slight decrease in the population of <this city> city, in favour of smaller towns in the metropolitan area.\nAccording to the population pyramid:\n\nPeople younger than 20 years old are 19% of the total population\nPeople between 20 and 40 years old are 23%\nPeople between 40 and 60 years old are 29%\nPeople older than 60 years old are 29%\n\nForeign population\n18,455 people living in the municipality of <this city> in 2021 were of foreign nationality, which represents 7.95% of total population, rate lower than the national average. Resident foreigners come from all continents, the most numerous being Moroccan (4,890), Chinese (1,047), Senegalese (947), Colombian (889), Italian (854), and Bolivian (763).\n\nHeritage and monuments\nAlhambra\nThe Alhambra is a fortified palace complex located on the Sabika hill, an outcrop of the Sierra Nevada which overlooks the city of <this city>. It is one of the most famous monuments of Islamic architecture and one of the best-preserved palaces of the historic Islamic world, in addition to containing notable examples of Spanish Renaissance architecture. It is one of <this country>'s major tourist attractions and a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1984.The complex was begun in 1238 by Muhammad I Ibn al-Ahmar, the first Nasrid emir, on the site of earlier fortresses and of the 11th-century palace of vizier Samuel ibn Naghrillah. Later Nasrid rulers continuously modified the site, most notably during the reigns of Yusuf I and Muhammad V in the 14th century. During this era, the Alhambra was a self-contained city separate from the rest of <this city> below. It contained most of the amenities of a Muslim city such as a Friday mosque, hammams (public baths), roads, houses, artisan workshops, a tannery, and a sophisticated water supply system. As a royal city and citadel, it contained at least six major palaces, most of them located along the northern edge where they commanded views over the Albaic\u00edn quarter. The most famous and best-preserved are the Mexuar, the Comares Palace, the Palace of the Lions, and the Partal Palace, which form the main attraction to visitors today. The other palaces are known from historical sources and from modern excavations. At the Alhambra's western tip is the Alcazaba fortress, the centerpiece of its defensive system. The architecture of the Nasrid palaces reflects the tradition of Moorish architecture developed over previous centuries. Decoration is focused on the inside of the building and was executed primarily with tile mosaics on lower walls and carved stucco on the upper walls. Geometric patterns, vegetal motifs, and Arabic calligraphy were the main types of decorative motifs. Additionally, \"stalactite\"-like sculpting, known as muqarnas, was used for three-dimensional features like vaulted ceilings.After the conclusion of the Reconquista in 1492, the site became the Royal Court of Ferdinand and Isabella (where Christopher Columbus received royal endorsement for his expedition), and the palaces were partially altered. In 1526, Charles V commissioned a new Renaissance-style palace, now known as the Palace of Charles V, in direct juxtaposition with the Nasrid palaces, but it was left uncompleted in the early 17th century. Other notable Renaissance additions from the reign of Charles V include the Emperor's Chambers and the Peinador de la Reina ('Queen's Robing Room'), which are connected to the former Nasrid Palaces.In the 18th century the Alhambra fell into severe neglect and parts of it were demolished by French troops in 1812. Through the course of the 19th century, the Alhambra was \"rediscovered\" by British, American, and other European Romantic travelers and intellectuals. The most influential of them was Washington Irving, whose Tales of the Alhambra (1832) brought international attention to the site. The Alhambra became one of the first Islamic monuments to become the object of modern scientific study and has been the subject of numerous restorations since the 19th century, a process which continues today.\n\nGeneralife\nThe Generalife is a Nasrid-era country estate or summer palace located just east of the Alhambra, on a sloping site above it. It was first built by Muhammad II and Muhammad III in the late 13th and early 14th centuries. This palace features several rectangular garden courtyards with decorated pavilions at either end and it was originally linked to the Alhambra by a walled corridor that crosses the valley between the two. It underwent modifications and redecoration under multiple later Nasrid rulers.The Generalife also underwent major alterations by Christian Spanish builders in the 16th century, which imparted Renaissance elements on the palace. In the 20th century a large area of modern landscaped gardens, known as the Jardines Nuevos ('New Gardens'), were added to the south of the Nasrid palace and form the main approach to it today. These date in large part to the work of Leopoldo Torres Balb\u00e1s and Francisco Prieto Moreno, between 1931 and 1951, who incorporated both Italian and Moorish influences in their design. An open-air auditorium was also added in 1952. Along with the Alhambra, the Generalife is a major tourist attraction and was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1984.\n\nCathedral\nThe cathedral of <this city> is built over the Nasrid Great Mosque of <this city>, in the centre of the city. Its construction began during the Spanish Renaissance in the early 16th century, shortly after the conquest of <this city> by the Catholic Monarchs, who commissioned the works to Juan Gil de Honta\u00f1\u00f3n and Enrique Egas. Numerous grand buildings were built in the reign of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, so that the cathedral is contemporary to the Christian palace of the Alhambra, the University and the Real Chanciller\u00eda (Supreme Court).\nThe church was conceived on the model of the Cathedral of Toledo, for what initially was a Gothic architectural project, as was customary in <this country> in the early decades of the 16th century. However, Egas was relieved by the Catholic hierarchy in 1529, and the continuation of the work was assigned to Diego Siloe, who built upon the example of his predecessor, but changed the approach towards a fully Renaissance aesthetic.The architect drew new Renaissance lines for the whole building over the gothic foundations, with an ambulatory and five naves instead of the usual three. Over time, the bishopric continued to commission new architectural projects of importance, such as the redesign of the main fa\u00e7ade, undertaken in 1664 by Alonso Cano (1601\u20131667) to introduce Baroque elements. In 1706 Francisco de Hurtado Izquierdo and later his collaborator Jos\u00e9 Bada built the current tabernacle of the cathedral.\nHighlights of the church's components include the main chapel, where may be found the praying statues of the Catholic Monarchs, which consists of a series of Corinthian columns with the entablature resting on their capitals, and the vault over all. The spaces of the walls between the columns are perforated by a series of windows. The design of the tabernacle of 1706 preserves the classic proportions of the church, with its multiple columns crossing the forms of Diego de Silo\u00e9.\n\nRoyal Chapel\nThe Catholic Monarchs chose the city of <this city> as their burial site by a royal decree dated September 13, 1504. The Royal Chapel of <this city>, built over the former terrace of the Great Mosque, ranks with other important <this city>n buildings such as the Lonja and the Catedral e Iglesia del Sagrario. In it are buried the Catholic Monarchs, their daughter Joanna of Castile (Juana la Loca) and her husband Felipe I (Felipe el Hermoso). Construction of the Chapel started in 1505, directed by its designer, Enrique Egas. Built in several stages, the continuing evolution of its design joined Gothic construction and decoration with Renaissance ideals, as seen in the tombs and the 17th and 18th century <this city>n art in the Chapel of Santa Cruz. Over the years the church acquired a treasury of works of art, liturgical objects and relics.\nThe Royal Chapel was declared a Historic Artistic Monument on May 19, 1884, taking consideration of BIC (Bien de Inter\u00e9s Cultural) status in the current legislation of Spanish Historical Heritage (Law 16/1985 of 25 June). The most important parts of the chapel are its main retable, grid and vault. In the Sacristy-Museum is the legacy of the Catholic Monarchs. Its art gallery is highlighted by works of the Flemish, Italian and Spanish schools.\n\nAlbayz\u00edn\nThe historic neighbourhood, located on the hillsides north of the Alhambra, still retains much of its medieval street plan dating back to the Nasrid period, although it has undergone physical and demographic changes since then. Archeological evidence indicates that Iberians inhabited the main hill of the present-day Albaicin towards the 7th century BC and that a significant town was located here during the Roman period. During the early Islamic period, up to the 10th century, the location hosted only the small settlement of Gharn\u0101\u1e6da (<this city>), until in the 11th century the creation of the Zirid Taifa kingdom transformed the location into one of the most important cities in Al-Andalus. During this period, the city's main citadel and palace, the al-Qa\u1e63aba al-Qad\u012bma (\"Old Citadel\"), was located on the top of this hill. During the Nasrid period, the citadel was moved to the Alhambra and the old district became known as al-Bayy\u0101z\u012bn (Arabic: \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0628\u064e\u064a\u0651\u0627\u0632\u0650\u064a\u0646\u0652), from which its present name derives. Among the various Nasrid-period houses and other structures, one notable establishment was the Maristan, a type of historic hospital (bimaristan) which also took care of the mentally ill.Through the course of the 16th century, after the surrender of <this city> to the Catholic Monarchs in 1492, the district underwent some of the some changes that occurred throughout the city. Mosques were replaced with new parish churches, particularly after 1501. These new churches were often built in a mix of Mud\u00e9jar and Renaissance styles, such as the Church of Santa Ana, the Church of San Crist\u00f3bal, and the Church of San Miguel Bajo, among others. Some, like the churches of San Salvador, San Jos\u00e9, and San Juan de los Reyes, preserve parts of former mosques. New civic institutions were also built in this area, such as the Royal Chancellery (Real Chanciller\u00eda), which overlooks Plaza Nueva, a wide public square expanded during the 16th century.During the 16th century the most of the city's morisco population was concentrated in the Albaic\u00edn, but after the 1568 rebellion and their subsequent expulsion, the district was depopulated. As a result, many of the remaining Christian residents expanded their residences to form carmens, traditional semi-rural houses with gardens or orchards, many examples of which survive today. Some of these houses and mansions, such as Casa de Zafra and the Dar al-Horra, date back to the Nasrid period. In 1994 the UNESCO World Heritage Site encompassing the Alhambra was extended to incorporate the Albaic\u00edn as well. In addition to its historic houses and mansions, churches, and the Royal Chancellery, the district also preserves sections of the 11th-century Zirid city walls (part of the former Zirid citadel), the 14th-century Nasrid walls, the Ba\u00f1uelo (a former Islamic-era bathhouse), and numerous cisterns from the Islamic period that were part of a water supply system providing water to most of the city's houses.\n\nSacromonte\nThe Sacromonte neighbourhood is located on the Valpara\u00edso hill, one of several hills that make up <this city>. This neighborhood is known as the old neighbourhood of the Romani, who settled in <this city> after the conquest of the city. It is one of the most picturesque neighborhoods, full of whitewashed caves cut into the rock and used as residences. The sound of strumming guitars may still be heard there in the performance of flamenco cantes and quej\u00edos, so that over time it has become one of the most popular tourist attractions in <this city>.\nAt the top of this hill is the Abbey of Sacromonte and the College of Sacromonte, founded in the 17th century by the then Archbishop of <this city> Pedro de Castro. The Abbey of Sacromonte was built to monitor and guard the alleged relics of the evangelists of Baetica. Those are of questionable authenticity, but since their finding the area has been a religious pilgrimage destination.The abbey complex consists of the catacombs, the abbey (17th\u201318th centuries), the Colegio Viejo de San Dionisio Areopagita (17th century) and the Colegio Nuevo (19th century). The interior of the church is simple and small but has numerous excellent works of art, which accentuate the size and rich carving of the Crucificado de Risue\u00f1o, an object of devotion for the Romani people, who sing and dance in the procession of Holy Week. The facilities also include a museum, which houses the works acquired by the Foundation.\n\nCharterhouse\nThe Charterhouse of <this city> is a monastery of cloistered monks, located in what was a farm or Muslim almunia called Aynadamar (\"fountain of tears\") that had an abundance of water and fruit trees. The initiative to build the monastery in that place was begun by Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba, known as El Gran Capit\u00e1n. The charterhouse was founded in 1506; construction started ten years later, and continued for the following 300 years.\nThe Monastery suffered heavy damage during the Peninsular War and lost considerable property in 1837 as a result of the confiscations of Mendiz\u00e1bal. Currently, the monastery belongs to the Carthusians, reporting directly to the Archdiocese of <this city>.The street entrance to the complex is an ornate arch of Plateresque style. Through it one reaches a large courtyard, at the end which is a wide staircase leading to the entrance of the church. The church, of early 16th century style and plan, has three entrances, one for the faithful and the other two for monks and clergy. Its plan has a single nave divided into four sections, highlighting the retables of Juan S\u00e1nchez Cot\u00e1n and the chancel's glass doors, adorned with mother-of-pearl, silver, rare woods, and ivory. The presbytery is covered by elliptical vaulting. The main altar, between the chancel arch and the church tabernacle, is gilded wood.\nThe church's tabernacle and sancta sanctorum are considered a masterpiece of Baroque Spanish art in its blend of architecture, painting and sculpture. The dome that covers this area is decorated with frescoes by the C\u00f3rdoba artist Antonio Palomino (18th century) representing the triumph of the Church Militant, faith, and religious life.\nThe courtyard, with galleries of arches on Doric order columns opening on it, is centered by a fountain. The Chapter House of Legos is the oldest building of the monastery (1517). It is rectangular and covered with groin vaulting.Mosque of <this city>\nThe Mosque of <this city> was inaugurated in 2003 on the summit of the neighborhood of Albayzin. The mosque was built near the Church of San Salvador and the Church of San Nicol\u00e1s. The Church of San Salvador was built on the site of the Great Mosque of Albayzin. The Society for the Return of Islam in <this country> purchased the site in 1981, but it took many years for the plans to be approved. The mosque's initial funding was supplied by Shaykh 'Abdalqadir as-Sufi al-Murabit who envisioned providing <this city>'s new Spanish Muslim community with a mosque. Additional funding came from Malaysia, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates. In 1991 the CIE (Comunidad Isl\u00e1mica en Espa\u00f1a) hired the architect Renato Ramirez Sanchez to design the mosque. In the 1990s, there was a heated debate pertaining to the design of the minaret. Construction eventually began in 2001. The mosque now serves about 500 people.\n\nPalace of the Marqu\u00e9s de Salar\nThe Palace of the Marqu\u00e9s de Salar was built in one of the most emblematic streets of <this city>, the Carrera del Darro, at number 5. This place is an architectural example of the classical <this city> during the Renaissance transformation of the XVIth century. It was built by the Marqu\u00e9s de Salar, great-grandson of both Hern\u00e1n P\u00e9rez del Pulgar (known by the name of El de la Haza\u00f1as [The One of the Valiant Deeds]) and Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba (El Gran Capit\u00e1n [The Great Captain]), Captain-General of the Castilian-Aragonese forces that concluded the Reconquest of the peninsula. The palace is now the museum of perfumes El Patio de los Perfumes, with 1,500 square metres (16,000 sq ft) of floor space on two floors and 130 square metres (1,400 sq ft) of patio to relax surrounded by flowers and perfumes.\n\nOther museums and monuments\nMonasterio de San Jer\u00f3nimo (16th-century Monastery of Saint Jerome)\nSan Juan de Dios Hospital (historic hospital)\nPalacio de la Madraza (remains of 14th-century madrasa incorporated into 18th-century city hall)\nArchaeological Museum of <this city> (in the 16th-century Castril Palace)\nMuseo de Bellas Artes de <this city> (Museum of Fine Arts)\nEl Ba\u00f1uelo (11th or 12th-century bathhouse)\nCorral del Carb\u00f3n (14th-century caravanserai, later converted to theatre)\nCuarto Real de Santo Domingo (13th-century palace, later converted to convent)\nPalacio de los Olvidados (16th century house and museum displaying torture instruments of the Spanish Inquisition)\nChurch of San Salvador (16th-century church, including remains of 13th-century mosque)Since 1988, there is in <this city> a monument honoring Judah ben Saul ibn Tibbon.\n\nPolitics and administration\nMetropolitan area of <this city>\n<this city>'s metropolitan area consists of about fifty municipalities and the capital. Although it is not formally constituted as a political and administrative body, there are several public services that are combined. The arrival of many inhabitants of the capital and other towns in the province, influences a large population growth. Despite the fact that the capital loses inhabitants, who move to neighboring towns. The main causes of the exodus towards the towns of the metropolitan area are, mainly, the difficulty of accessing a home in the capital because of the high prices it has and labor reasons, because in the towns of the periphery the majority are being located of industrial estates.\n\nCapital of <this city> Province\nThe city of <this city> is the capital of the province of the same name, thus all administrative entities of provincial scope dependent on the regional government and the state are located there. There is a provincial delegation from each of the governmental departments to the Junta de Andaluc\u00eda, coordinated by a government delegate under the Ministry of the Interior. The national government of <this country> has a sub-delegation in <this city>, subordinate to the government delegate in the autonomous community.\n\nJudicial administration\nThe headquarters of the Superior Court of Justice of Andalusia, Ceuta and Melilla is in <this city>, located in Plaza Nueva, in the building of the historic Royal Chancery, as well as the Superior Prosecutor's Office of Andalusia, located in the building of the Bank of <this country>. It has a Provincial Court, located in Corteza del Carmen Street, and is also head of the Judicial Party No. 3 of the province, whose demarcation includes the city and 49 towns, some of them very populated, in the metropolitan area region.\nMost of the courts are located in two administrative buildings, in Plaza Nueva and Avenida del Sur. The set of judicial bodies is as follows:\n\nSuperior Court of Justice: President. Civil-Criminal Chamber. Contentious-Administrative Room. Social room.\nProvincial Court: President.

(The centuries since the Jewish population were so important that <this city> was known in Al-Andalus under the name of \"<this city> of the Jews\", Arabic: \u063a\u0631\u0646\u0627\u0637\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0647\u0648\u062f Gharn\u0101\u1e6dah al-Yah\u016bd.) It is today a district made up of many Granadinian villas, with gardens opening onto the streets, called Los C\u00e1rmenes.\n\nCartuja\nThis district contains the Carthusian monastery of the same name: Cartuja. This is an old monastery started in a late Gothic style with Baroque exuberant interior decorations. In this district also, many buildings were created with the extension of the University of <this city>.\n\nBib-Rambla\nThe toponym derives from a gate (Bab al-Ramla, or the Gate of the Ears) that was built when <this city> was controlled by the Nasrid dynasty. Nowadays, Bib-Rambla is a high point for gastronomy, especially in its terraces of restaurants, open on beautiful days. The Arab bazaar, the Alcaicer\u00eda, is made up of several narrow streets, which start from this place and continue as far as the cathedral.\n\nSacromonte\nThe Sacromonte neighborhood is located on the extension of the hill of Albaic\u00edn, along the Darro River. This area, which became famous by the nineteenth century for its predominantly Gitano inhabitants, is characterized by cave houses, which are dug into the hillside. The area has a reputation as a major center of flamenco song and dance, including the Zambra Gitana, an Andalusian dance originating in the Middle East. The zone is a protected cultural environment under the auspices of the Centro de Interpretaci\u00f3n del Sacromonte, a cultural center dedicated to the preservation of Gitano cultural forms.\n\nZaid\u00edn\nThis formerly blue collar but now upmarket neighborhood houses 100,000 residents of <this city>, making it the largest neighborhood or 'barrio'. Traditionally populated by Romani people, now many residents are from North and West Africa, China, and many South American countries. Every Saturday morning it hosts a large outdoor market or \"mercadillo\", where many people come and sell their wares of fruits and vegetables, clothes and shoes, and other bits and bobs.\n\nGastronomy\nThe gastronomy of <this city> is part of the Arabic-Andalusian cuisine tradition, with a strong Arab and Jewish heritage, which is reflected in its condiments and spices, such as cumin, coriander, nutmeg, cinnamon, raisins, almonds or honey. The writer Miguel Alcobendas, author of the traditional cuisine of <this city>, says that it has its origin in living together, from the thirteenth to the fifteenth century (when <this city> surrendered to the Catholic Monarchs), of Muslims, Jews and Christians in the Nasrid Kingdom from <this city>. Subsequently, there was a miscegenation with the kitchen of the Christians, in which the pork acquired an importance in the kitchen of <this city> more than in the rest of <this country>, since its consumption allowed its eaters to demonstrate a certain distance from the persecuted religions, since both Muslims and Jews have it banned.\nThe climatic differences of the different regions of the province, from the coast to the peaks of the Sierra Nevada propitiates a great variety of raw materials: vegetables, meats and sausages, and fish that are combined in a multitude of dishes and recipes for soups and stews.\nThe famous and reputed Trev\u00e9lez ham comes from the Sierra of <this city>, to which other pork derivatives are added, sausages such as chorizo, black pudding and pork tenderloin.\nHam and beans, two products of the land, are combined in one of its most typical dishes, beans with ham; Other known dishes are the Sacromonte tortilla, which among other ingredients must have cooked brains and veal crustaillas, chopped and sauteed before mixing with the egg. It is also worth mentioning \"papas a lo pobre\", potatoes which are usually served with egg and fried peppers, as well as with pieces of pork or ham.\nAmong the stews and potajes, the pot of San Ant\u00f3n stands out, which is eaten mainly towards the second half of January; cabbage stew, which combines vegetables and legumes; the stew of green beans and fennel; The thistle and pumpkin casserole, with noodles and aromatic herbs, or gypsy pottery are other dishes of the land.\nConfectionery is well represented in the gastronomy of <this city>, for sweets prepared by the nuns can be purchased in the numerous convents of the city: the pesti\u00f1os of V\u00e9lez or those of the Encarnaci\u00f3n, the puff pastries of San Jer\u00f3nimo, the ovos moles of San Ant\u00f3n, the Zafra biscuit, sweet potato rolls, cocas, roscos from Santo Tomas and mantecados. Aljoj\u00e1banas, honey and cheese dumplings and some of the fritters called almohados, as well as fig bread, Moorish roscos and an almond cake called soy\u00e1 are all of Arabic heritage.\nUnlike in other provinces of Andalusia, in <this city> tapas (appetizers or snacks) are usually free in bars and restaurants. \"Bar hopping\" (Ir de tapas) and eating tapas in the time between finishing work and having dinner is a deeply rooted traditional activity among the people of <this city>. There are different tapas routes around the city.\n\nEconomy\n<this city> produces agricultural products such as barley, wheat, sugarcane and tobacco. Besides these crops, olive trees as well as oranges, lemons, figs, almonds, and pomegranates are also commonly grown. For manufacturing, sugar refining is also made in the city.
