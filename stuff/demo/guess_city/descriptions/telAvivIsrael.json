Located on the <this country>i Mediterranean coastline and with a population of 467,875, it is the economic and technological center of the country. If East Jerusalem is considered part of <this country>, <this city> is the country's second most populous city after Jerusalem; if not, <this city> is the most populous city ahead of West Jerusalem.<this city> is governed by the <this city>-Yafo Municipality, headed by Mayor Ron Huldai, and is home to most of <this country>'s foreign embassies. It is a beta+ world city and is ranked 57th in the 2022 Global Financial Centres Index. <this city> has the third- or fourth-largest economy and the largest economy per capita in the Middle East. The city currently has the highest cost of living in the world. <this city> receives over 2.5 million international visitors annually. A \"party capital\" in the Middle East, it has a lively nightlife and 24-hour culture. The city is gay-friendly, with a large LGBT community. <this city> is home to <this city> University, the largest university in the country with more than 30,000 students.\nThe city was founded in 1909 by the Yishuv (Jewish residents) as a modern housing estate on the outskirts of the ancient port city of Jaffa (Yafo in Hebrew), then part of the Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem within the Ottoman Empire. It was at first called Ahuzat Bayit (lit. \"House Estate\" or \"Homestead\"), the name of the association which established the neighbourhood. Its name was changed the following year to <this city>, after the biblical name Tel Abib (lit. \"Tell of Spring\") adopted by Nahum Sokolow as the title for his Hebrew translation of Theodor Herzl's 1902 novel Altneuland (\"Old New Land\"). Other Jewish suburbs of Jaffa had been established before <this city>, the oldest among them being Neve Tzedek. <this city> was given township status within the Jaffa Municipality in 1921, and became independent from Jaffa in 1934. Immigration by mostly Jewish refugees meant that the growth of <this city> soon outpaced that of Jaffa, which had a majority Arab population at the time. In 1948 the <this country>i Declaration of Independence was proclaimed in the city. After the 1947\u20131949 Palestine war, <this city> began the municipal annexation of parts of Jaffa, fully unified with Jaffa under the name <this city> in April 1950, and was formally renamed to <this city>-Yafo in August 1950.<this city>'s White City, designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2003, comprises the world's largest concentration of International Style buildings, including Bauhaus and other related modernist architectural styles. Popular attractions include Jaffa Old City, the Eretz <this country> Museum, the Museum of Art, Hayarkon Park, and the city's promenade and beach.\n\nEtymology and origins\n<this city> is the Hebrew title of Theodor Herzl's Altneuland (\"Old New Land\"), translated from German by Nahum Sokolow. Sokolow had adopted the name of a Mesopotamian site near the city of Babylon mentioned in Ezekiel: \"Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel Abib [<this city>], that lived by the river Chebar, and to where they lived; and I sat there overwhelmed among them seven days.\" The name was chosen in 1910 from several suggestions, including \"Herzliya\". It was found fitting as it embraced the idea of a renaissance in the ancient Jewish homeland. Aviv (\u05d0\u05d1\u05d9\u05d1, or Abib) is a Hebrew word that can be translated as \"spring\", symbolizing renewal, and tell (or tel) is an artificial mound created over centuries through the accumulation of successive layers of civilization built one over the other and symbolizing the ancient.\nAlthough founded in 1909 as a small settlement on the sand dunes north of Jaffa, <this city> was envisaged as a future city from the start. Its founders hoped that in contrast to what they perceived as the squalid and unsanitary conditions of neighbouring Arab towns, <this city> was to be a clean and modern city, inspired by the European cities of Warsaw and Odesa. The marketing pamphlets advocating for its establishment stated:\nIn this city we will build the streets so they have roads and sidewalks and electric lights. Every house will have water from wells that will flow through pipes as in every modern European city, and also sewerage pipes will be installed for the health of the city and its residents.\n\nHistory\nJaffa\nThe walled city of Jaffa was the only urban centre in the general area where now <this city> is located in early modern times. Jaffa was an important port city in the region for millennia. Archaeological evidence shows signs of human settlement there starting in roughly 7,500 BC. The city was established around 1,800 BC at the latest. Its natural harbour has been used since the Bronze Age. By the time <this city> was founded as a separate city during Ottoman rule of the region, Jaffa had been ruled by the Canaanites, Egyptians, Philistines, <this country>ites, Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, Phoenicians, Ptolemies, Seleucids, Hasmoneans, Romans, Byzantines, the early Islamic caliphates, Crusaders, Ayyubids, and Mamluks before coming under Ottoman rule in 1515. It had been fought over numerous times. The city is mentioned in ancient Egyptian documents, as well as the Hebrew Bible.\nOther ancient sites in <this city> include: Tell Qasile, Tel Gerisa, Abattoir Hill, Tel Hashash, and Tell Qudadi.\nDuring the First Aliyah in the 1880s, when Jewish immigrants began arriving in the region in significant numbers, new neighborhoods were founded outside Jaffa on the current territory of <this city>. The first was Neve Tzedek, founded in 1887 by Mizrahi Jews due to overcrowding in Jaffa and built on lands owned by Aharon Chelouche. Other neighborhoods were Neve Shalom (1890), Yafa Nof (1896), Achva (1899), Ohel Moshe (1904), Kerem HaTeimanim (1906), and others. Once <this city> received city status in the 1920s, those neighborhoods joined the newly formed municipality, now becoming separated from Jaffa.\n\n1904\u20131917: Foundation in the Late Ottoman Period\nThe Second Aliyah led to further expansion. In 1906, a group of Jews, among them residents of Jaffa, followed the initiative of Akiva Aryeh Weiss and banded together to form the Ahuzat Bayit (lit. \"homestead\") society. One of the society's goals was to form a \"Hebrew urban centre in a healthy environment, planned according to the rules of aesthetics and modern hygiene\". The urban planning for the new city was influenced by the garden city movement. The first 60 plots were purchased in Kerem Djebali near Jaffa by Jacobus Kann, a Dutch citizen, who registered them in his name to circumvent the Turkish prohibition on Jewish land acquisition. Meir Dizengoff, later <this city>'s first mayor, also joined the Ahuzat Bayit society. His vision for <this city> involved peaceful co-existence with Arabs.On 11 April 1909, 66 Jewish families gathered on a desolate sand dune to parcel out the land by lottery using seashells. This gathering is considered the official date of the establishment of <this city>. The lottery was organised by Akiva Aryeh Weiss, president of the building society. Weiss collected 120 sea shells on the beach, half of them white and half of them grey. The members' names were written on the white shells and the plot numbers on the grey shells. A boy drew names from one box of shells and a girl drew plot numbers from the second box. A photographer, Abraham Soskin, documented the event. The first water well was later dug at this site, located on what is today Rothschild Boulevard, across from Dizengoff House. Within a year, Herzl, Ahad Ha'am, Yehuda Halevi, Lilienblum, and Rothschild streets were built; a water system was installed; and 66 houses (including some on six subdivided plots) were completed. At the end of Herzl Street, a plot was allocated for a new building for the Herzliya Hebrew High School, founded in Jaffa in 1906. The cornerstone for the building was laid on 28 July 1909. The town was originally named Ahuzat Bayit. On 21 May 1910, the name <this city> was adopted. The flag and city arms of <this city> (see above) contain under the red Star of David 2 words from the biblical book of Jeremiah: \"I (God) will build You up again and you will be rebuilt.\" (Jer 31:4) <this city> was planned as an independent Hebrew city with wide streets and boulevards, running water for each house, and street lights.By 1914, <this city> had grown to more than 1 km2 (247 acres). In 1915 a census of <this city> was conducted, recording a population 2,679. However, growth halted in 1917 when the Ottoman authorities expelled the residents of Jaffa and <this city> as a wartime measure. A report published in The New York Times by United States Consul Garrels in Alexandria, Egypt described the Jaffa deportation of early April 1917. The orders of evacuation were aimed chiefly at the Jewish population. Jews were free to return to their homes in <this city> at the end of the following year when, with the end of World War I and the defeat of the Ottomans, the British took control of Palestine.\nThe town had rapidly become an attraction to immigrants, with a local activist writing:\nThe immigrants were attracted to <this city> because they found in it all the comforts they were used to in Europe: electric light, water, a little cleanliness, cinema, opera, theatre, and also more or less advanced schools... busy streets, full restaurants, cafes open until 2 a.m., singing, music, and dancing.\n\nBritish administration 1917\u201334: Townships within the Jaffa Municipality\nA master plan for the <this city> township was created by Patrick Geddes, 1925, based on the garden city movement. The plan consisted of four main features: a hierarchical system of streets laid out in a grid, large blocks consisting of small-scale domestic dwellings, the organization of these blocks around central open spaces, and the concentration of cultural institutions to form a civic center.<this city>, along with the rest of the Jaffa municipality, was conquered by the British imperial army in late 1917 during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of World War I and became part of British-administered Mandatory Palestine until 1948.\n<this city>, established as suburb of Jaffa, received \"township\" or local council status within the Jaffa Municipality in 1921. According to a census conducted in 1922 by the British Mandate authorities, the <this city> township had a population of 15,185 inhabitants, consisting of 15,065 Jews, 78 Muslims and 42 Christians.\nIncreasing in the 1931 census to 46,101, in 12,545 houses.With increasing Jewish immigration during the British administration, friction between Arabs and Jews in Palestine increased. On 1 May 1921, the Jaffa riots resulted in the deaths of 48 Arabs and 47 Jews and injuries to 146 Jews and 73 Arabs. In the wake of this violence, many Jews left Jaffa for <this city>. The population of <this city> increased from 2,000 in 1920 to around 34,000 by 1925.<this city> began to develop as a commercial center. In 1923, <this city> was the first town to be wired to electricity in Palestine, followed by Jaffa later in the same year. The opening ceremony of the Jaffa Electric Company powerhouse, on 10 June 1923, celebrated the lighting of the two main streets of <this city>.In 1925, the Scottish biologist, sociologist, philanthropist and pioneering town planner Patrick Geddes drew up a master plan for <this city> which was adopted by the city council led by Meir Dizengoff. Geddes's plan for developing the northern part of the district was based on Ebenezer Howard's garden city movement. While most of the northern area of <this city> was built according to this plan, the influx of European refugees in the 1930s necessitated the construction of taller apartment buildings on a larger footprint in the city.Ben Gurion House was built in 1930\u201331, part of a new workers' housing development. At the same time, Jewish cultural life was given a boost by the establishment of the Ohel Theatre and the decision of Habima Theatre to make <this city> its permanent base in 1931.\n\n1934 municipal independence from Jaffa\n<this city> was granted the status of an independent municipality separate from Jaffa in 1934. The Jewish population rose dramatically during the Fifth Aliyah after the Nazis came to power in Germany. By 1937 the Jewish population of <this city> had risen to 150,000, compared to Jaffa's mainly Arab 69,000 residents. Within two years, it had reached 160,000, which was over a third of Palestine's total Jewish population. Many new Jewish immigrants to Palestine disembarked in Jaffa, and remained in <this city>, turning the city into a center of urban life. Friction during the 1936\u201339 Arab revolt led to the opening of a local Jewish port, <this city> Port, independent of Jaffa, in 1938. It closed on 25 October 1965. Lydda Airport (later Ben Gurion Airport) and Sde Dov Airport opened between 1937 and 1938.Many German Jewish architects trained at the Bauhaus, the Modernist school of architecture in Germany, and left Germany during the 1930s. Some, like Arieh Sharon, came to Palestine and adapted the architectural outlook of the Bauhaus and similar schools to the local conditions there, creating what is recognized as the largest concentration of buildings in the International Style in the world.<this city>'s White City emerged in the 1930s, and became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2003. During World War II, <this city> was hit by Italian airstrikes on 9 September 1940, which killed 137 people in the city.During the Jewish insurgency in Mandatory Palestine, Jewish Irgun and Lehi guerrillas launched repeated attacks against British military, police, and government targets in the city. In 1946, following the King David Hotel bombing, the British carried out Operation Shark, in which the entire city was searched for Jewish militants and most of the residents questioned, during which the entire city was placed under curfew. During the March 1947 martial law in Mandatory Palestine, <this city> was placed under martial law by the British authorities for 15 days, with the residents kept under curfew for all but three hours a day as British forces scoured the city for militants. In spite of this, Jewish guerrilla attacks continued in <this city> and other areas under martial law in Palestine.\nAccording to the 1947 UN Partition Plan for dividing Palestine into Jewish and Arab states, <this city>, by then a city of 230,000, was to be included in the proposed Jewish state. Jaffa with, as of 1945, a population of 101,580 people\u201453,930 Muslims, 30,820 Jews and 16,800 Christians\u2014was designated as part of the Arab state. Civil War broke out in the country and in particular between the neighbouring cities of <this city> and Jaffa, which had been assigned to the Jewish and Arab states respectively. After several months of siege, on 13 May 1948, Jaffa fell and the Arab population fled en masse.\n\nState of <this country>\nWhen <this country> declared Independence on 14 May 1948, the population of <this city> was over 200,000. <this city> was the temporary government center of the State of <this country> until the government moved to Jerusalem in December 1949. Due to the international dispute over the status of Jerusalem, most embassies remained in or near <this city>. The boundaries of <this city> and Jaffa became a matter of contention between the <this city> municipality and the <this country>i government in 1948. The former wished to incorporate only the northern Jewish suburbs of Jaffa, while the latter wanted a more complete unification. The issue also had international sensitivity, since the main part of Jaffa was in the Arab portion of the United Nations Partition Plan, whereas <this city> was not, and no armistice agreements had yet been signed. On 10 December 1948, the government announced the annexation to <this city> of Jaffa's Jewish suburbs, the Palestinian neighborhood of Abu Kabir, the Arab village of Salama and some of its agricultural land, and the Jewish Hatikva slum. On 25 February 1949, the depopulated Palestinian village of al-Shaykh Muwannis was also annexed to <this city>. On 18 May 1949, Manshiya and part of Jaffa's central zone were added, for the first time including land that had been in the Arab portion of the UN partition plan. The government voted on the unification of <this city> and Jaffa on 4 October 1949, but the decision was not implemented until 24 April 1950 due to the opposition of <this city> mayor <this country> Rokach. The name of the unified city was <this city> until 19 August 1950, when it was renamed <this city>-Yafo in order to preserve the historical name Jaffa. <this city> thus grew to 42 km2 (16.2 sq mi). In 1949, a memorial to the 60 founders of <this city> was constructed.\nIn the 1960s, some of the older buildings were demolished, making way for the country's first high-rises. The historic Herzliya Hebrew Gymnasium was controversially demolished, to make way for the Shalom Meir Tower, which was completed in 1965, and remained <this country>'s tallest building until 1999. <this city>'s population peaked in the early 1960s at 390,000, representing 16 percent of the country's total. By the early 1970s, <this city> had entered a long and steady period of continuous population decline, which was accompanied by urban decay. By 1981, <this city> had entered not just natural population decline, but an absolute population decline as well. In the late 1980s the city had an aging population of 317,000. Construction activity had moved away from the inner ring of <this city>, and had moved to its outer perimeter and adjoining cities. A mass out-migration of residents from <this city>, to adjoining cities like Petah Tikva and Rehovot, where better housing conditions were available, was underway by the beginning of the 1970s, and only accelerated by the Yom Kippur War. Cramped housing conditions and high property prices pushed families out of <this city> and deterred young people from moving in. From the beginning of 1970s, the common image of <this city> became that of a decaying city, as <this city>'s population fell 20%.\nIn the 1970s, the apparent sense of <this city>'s urban decline became a theme in the work of novelists such as Yaakov Shabtai, in works describing the city such as Sof Davar (The End of Things) and Zikhron Devarim (The Memory of Things). A symptomatic article of 1980 asked \"Is <this city> Dying?\" and portrayed what it saw as the city's existential problems: \"Residents leaving the city, businesses penetrating into residential areas, economic and social gaps, deteriorating neighbourhoods, contaminated air \u2013 Is the First Hebrew City destined for a slow death? Will it become a ghost town?\". However, others saw this as a transitional period. By the late 1980s, attitudes to the city's future had become markedly more optimistic. It had also become a center of nightlife and discotheques for <this country>is who lived in the suburbs and adjoining cities. By 1989, <this city> had acquired the nickname \"Nonstop City\", as a reflection of the growing recognition of its nightlife and 24/7 culture, and \"Nonstop City\" had to some extent replaced the former moniker of \"First Hebrew City\". The largest project built in this era was the Dizengoff Center, <this country>'s first shopping mall, which was completed in 1983. Other notable projects included the construction of Marganit Tower in 1987, the opening of the Suzanne Dellal Center for Dance and Theater in 1989, and the <this city> Cinematheque (opened in 1973 and located to the current building in 1989).\n\nIn the early 1980s, 13 embassies in Jerusalem moved to <this city> as part of the UN's measures responding to <this country>'s 1980 Jerusalem Law. Today, most national embassies are located in <this city> or environs. In the 1990s, the decline in <this city>'s population began to be reversed and stabilized, at first temporarily due to a wave of immigrants from the former Soviet Union. <this city> absorbed 42,000 immigrants from the FSU, many educated in scientific, technological, medical and mathematical fields. In this period, the number of engineers in the city doubled. <this city> soon began to emerge as a global high-tech center. The construction of many skyscrapers and high-tech office buildings followed. In 1993, <this city> was categorized as a world city. However, the city's municipality struggled to cope with an influx of new immigrants. <this city>'s tax base had been shrinking for many years, as a result of its preceding long term population decline, and this meant there was little money available at the time to invest in the city's deteriorating infrastructure and housing. In 1998, <this city> was on the \"verge of bankruptcy\". Economic difficulties would then be compounded by a wave of Palestinian suicide bombings in the city from the mid-1990s, to the end of the Second Intifada, as well as the dot-com bubble, which affected the city's rapidly growing hi-tech sector. On 4 November 1995, <this country>'s prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin, was assassinated at a rally in <this city> in support of the Oslo peace accord. The outdoor plaza where this occurred, formerly known as Kikar Malchei Yisrael, was renamed Rabin Square.\nIn the Gulf War in 1991, <this city> was attacked by Scud missiles from Iraq. Iraq hoped to provoke an <this country>i military response, which could have destroyed the US\u2013Arab alliance. The United States pressured <this country> not to retaliate, and after <this country> acquiesced, the US and Netherlands rushed Patriot missiles to defend against the attacks, but they proved largely ineffective. <this city> and other <this country>i cities continued to be hit by Scuds throughout the war, and every city in the <this city> area except for Bnei Brak was hit. A total of 74 <this country>is died as a result of the Iraqi attacks, mostly from suffocation and heart attacks, while approximately 230 <this country>is were injured. Extensive property damage was also caused, and some 4,000 <this country>is were left homeless. It was feared that Iraq would fire missiles filled with nerve agents or sarin. As a result, the <this country>i government issued gas masks to its citizens. When the first Iraqi missiles hit <this country>, some people injected themselves with an antidote for nerve gas. The inhabitants of the southeastern suburb of Hatikva erected an angel-monument as a sign of their gratitude that \"it was through a great miracle, that many people were preserved from being killed by a direct hit of a Scud rocket.\"\nSince the First Intifada, <this city> has suffered from Palestinian political violence. The first suicide attack in <this city> occurred on 19 October 1994, on the Line 5 bus, when a bomber killed 22 civilians and injured 50 as part of a Hamas suicide campaign. On 6 March 1996, another Hamas suicide bomber killed 13 people (12 civilians and 1 soldier), many of them children, in the Dizengoff Center suicide bombing. Three women were killed by a Hamas terrorist in the Caf\u00e9 Apropo bombing on 27 March 1997.\nOne of the deadliest attacks occurred on 1 June 2001, during the Second Intifada, when a suicide bomber exploded at the entrance to the Dolphinarium discoth\u00e8que, killing 21, mostly teenagers, and injuring 132. Another Hamas suicide bomber killed six civilians and injured 70 in the Allenby Street bus bombing. Twenty-three civilians were killed and over 100 injured in the <this city> central bus station massacre. Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades claimed responsibility for the attack. In the Mike's Place suicide bombing, an attack on a bar by a British Muslim suicide bomber resulted in the deaths of three civilians and wounded over 50. Hamas and Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades claimed joint responsibility. An Islamic Jihad bomber killed five and wounded over 50 on 25 February 2005 Stage Club bombing. The most recent suicide attack in the city occurred on 17 April 2006, when 11 people were killed and at least 70 wounded in a suicide bombing near the old central bus station.\nAnother attack took place on 29 August 2011 in which a Palestinian attacker stole an <this country>i taxi cab and rammed it into a police checkpoint guarding the popular Haoman 17 nightclub in <this city> which was filled with 2,000 <this country>i teenagers. After crashing, the assailant went on a stabbing spree, injuring eight people. Due to an <this country> Border Police roadblock at the entrance and immediate response of the Border Police team during the subsequent stabbings, a much larger and fatal mass-casualty incident was avoided.On 21 November 2012, during Operation Pillar of Defense, the <this city> area was targeted by rockets, and air raid sirens were sounded in the city for the first time since the Gulf War. All of the rockets either missed populated areas or were shot down by an Iron Dome rocket defense battery stationed near the city. During the operation, a bomb blast on a bus wounded at least 28 civilians, three seriously. This was described as a terrorist attack by <this country>, Russia, and the United States and was condemned by the United Nations, United States, United Kingdom, France and Russia, whilst Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri declared that the organisation \"blesses\" the attack. More than 300 rockets were fired towards the <this city> Metropolitan area in the 2021 <this country>\u2013Palestine crisis.\nNew laws were introduced to protect Modernist buildings, and efforts to preserve them were aided by UNESCO recognition of <this city>'s White City as a world heritage site in 2003. In the early 2000s, <this city> municipality focused on attracting more young residents to the city. It made significant investment in major boulevards, to create attractive pedestrian corridors. Former industrial areas like the city's previously derelict Northern <this city> Port and the Jaffa railway station, were upgraded and transformed into leisure areas. A process of gentrification began in some of the poor neighborhoods of southern <this city> and many older buildings began to be renovated.The demographic profile of the city changed in the 2000s, as it began to attract a higher proportion of young residents. By 2012, 28 percent of the city's population was aged between 20 and 34 years old. Between 2007 and 2012, the city's population growth averaged 6.29 percent. As a result of its population recovery and industrial transition, the city's finances were transformed, and by 2012 it was running a budget surplus and maintained a credit rating of AAA+. In the 2000s and early 2010s, <this city> received tens of thousands of illegal immigrants, primarily from Sudan and Eritrea, changing the demographic profile of areas of the city. In 2009, <this city> celebrated its official centennial. In addition to city- and country-wide celebrations, digital collections of historical materials were assembled. These include the History section of the official <this city>-Yafo Centennial Year website; the Ahuzat Bayit collection, which focuses on the founding families of <this city>, and includes photographs and biographies; and Stanford University's Eliasaf Robinson <this city> Collection, documenting the history of the city. Today, the city is regarded as a strong candidate for global city status. Over the past 60 years, <this city> had developed into a secular, liberal-minded center with a vibrant nightlife and caf\u00e9 culture.\n\nGeography\n<this city> is located around 32\u00b05\u2032N 34\u00b048\u2032E on the <this country>i Mediterranean coastline, in central <this country>, the historic land bridge between Europe, Asia and Africa. Immediately north of the ancient port of Jaffa, <this city> lies on land that used to be sand dunes and as such has relatively poor soil fertility. The land has been flattened and has no important gradients; its most notable geographical features are bluffs above the Mediterranean coastline and the Yarkon River mouth. Because of the expansion of <this city> and the Gush Dan region, absolute borders between <this city> and Jaffa and between the city's neighborhoods do not exist.\nThe city is located 60 km (37 mi) northwest of Jerusalem and 90 km (56 mi) south of the city of Haifa. Neighboring cities and towns include Herzliya to the north, Ramat HaSharon to the northeast, Petah Tikva, Bnei Brak, Ramat Gan and Giv'atayim to the east, Holon to the southeast, and Bat Yam to the south. The city is economically stratified between the north and south. Southern <this city> is considered less affluent than northern <this city> with the exception of Neve Tzedek and northern and north-western Jaffa. Central <this city> is home to Azrieli Center and the important financial and commerce district along Ayalon Highway. The northern side of <this city> is home to <this city> University, Hayarkon Park, and upscale residential neighborhoods such as Ramat Aviv and Afeka.\n\nEnvironment\n<this city> is ranked as the greenest city in <this country>. Since 2008, city lights are turned off annually in support of Earth Hour. In February 2009, the municipality launched a water saving campaign, including competition granting free parking for a year to the household that is found to have consumed the least water per person.In the early 21st century, <this city>'s municipality transformed a derelict power station into a public park, now named \"Gan HaHashmal\" (\"Electricity Park\"), paving the way for eco-friendly and environmentally conscious designs. In October 2008, Martin Weyl turned an old garbage dump near Ben Gurion International Airport, called Hiriya, into an attraction by building an arc of plastic bottles.

The early architecture of <this city> consisted largely of European-style single-storey houses with red-tiled roofs. Neve Tzedek, the first neighbourhood to be built outside of Jaffa, is characterised by two-storey sandstone buildings. By the 1920s, a new eclectic Orientalist style came into vogue, combining European architecture with Eastern features such as arches, domes and ornamental tiles. Pagoda House (Beit HaPagoda), designed by Alexander Levy and built in 1924, is an example of this style. Municipal construction followed the \"garden city\" master plan drawn up by Patrick Geddes. Two- and three-storey buildings were interspersed with boulevards and public parks. Various architectural styles, such as Art Deco, classical and modernist also exist in <this city>.\n\nBauhaus architecture was introduced in the 1920s and 1930s by German Jewish architects who settled in Palestine after the rise of the Nazis. <this city>'s White City, around the city center, contains more than 5,000 Modernist-style buildings inspired by the Bauhaus school and Le Corbusier. Construction of these buildings, later declared protected landmarks and, collectively, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, continued until the 1950s in the area around Rothschild Boulevard. Some 3,000 buildings were created in this style between 1931 and 1939 alone. In the 1960s, this architectural style gave way to office towers and a chain of waterfront hotels and commercial skyscrapers. Some of the city's Modernist buildings were neglected to the point of ruin. Before legislation to preserve this landmark architecture, many of the old buildings were demolished. Efforts are under way to refurbish Bauhaus buildings and restore them to their original condition.\nThe Shalom Meir Tower, <this country>'s first skyscraper, was built in <this city> in 1965 and remained the country's tallest building until 1999.

Before that, <this city> had had a generally low-rise skyline. In 2010, the <this city> Municipality's Planning and Construction Committee launched a new master plan for the city for 2025. It decided not to allow the construction of any additional skyscrapers in the city center, while at the same time greatly increasing the construction of skyscrapers in the east. The ban extends to an area between the coast and Ibn Gabirol Street, and also between the Yarkon River and Eilat Street. It did not extend to towers already under construction or approved. One final proposed skyscraper project was approved, while dozens of others had to be scrapped. Any new buildings there will usually not be allowed to rise above six and a half stories. However, hotel towers along almost the entire beachfront will be allowed to rise up to 25 stories. According to the plan, large numbers of skyscrapers and high-rise buildings at least 18 stories tall would be built in the entire area between Ibn Gabirol Street and the eastern city limits, as part of the master plan's goal of doubling the city's office space to cement <this city> as the business capital of <this country>. Under the plan, \"forests\" of corporate skyscrapers will line both sides of the Ayalon Highway. Further south, skyscrapers rising up to 40 stories will be built along the old Ottoman railway between Neve Tzedek and Florentine, with the first such tower there being the Neve Tzedek Tower.

Fares are standardised and metered, but may be negotiated ahead of time with the driver.\n\nRail\nThe <this city> Savidor Central railway station is the main railway station of the city, and the second-busiest station in <this country>. The city has five additional railway stations along the Ayalon Highway: three of them, <this city> University, HaShalom (the busiest station in <this country>, adjacent to Azrieli Center) and HaHagana (near the <this city> central bus station), serve <this city> directly, while the remaining two, Holon Junction and Holon-Wolfson, are within <this city>'s municipal boundaries but serve the southern suburb of Holon. It is estimated that over a million passengers travel by rail to <this city> monthly. The trains do not run on Saturday and the principal Jewish festivals (Rosh Hashana (2 days), Yom Kippur, Sukkot, Simkhat Torah, Pessach (Passover) first and fifth days and Shavuot (Pentecost)). Jaffa railway station was the first railway station in the Middle East. It served as the terminus for the Jaffa\u2013Jerusalem railway. The station opened in 1891 and closed in 1948. In 2005\u20132009, the station was restored and converted into an entertainment and leisure venue marketed as \"HaTachana\", Hebrew for \"the station\" (see homepage here:). The Jaffa\u2013Jerusalem railway also included the <this city> Beit Hadar railway station, which was opened in 1920 and replaced in 1970, and the <this city> South railway station, which was opened in 1970 to replace Beit Hadar and itself closed in 1993. The Bnei Brak railway station, while located in Bnei Brak's municipal borders, is closer to the <this city> neighborhood of Ramat HaHayal than to Bnei Brak's city center and was originally called <this city> North.\n\n<this city> Light Rail is a planned mass transit system for the <this city> metropolitan area. As of 2021, three LRT lines are under construction. Work on the Red Line, the first in the project, started on September 21, 2011, following years of preparatory works, and is expected to be completed in late 2022 after numerous delays. Construction of the Purple Line started in December 2018; work on the Green Line began in 2021 and is scheduled for completion in 2028. <this city> Metro is a proposed subway system for the <this city> Metropolitan Area. It will augment the <this city> Light Rail and <this country> Railways suburban lines and 3 underground metro lines to form a rapid transit transportation solution for the city. Construction is expected to start in 2025, with the first public opening in 2032.\n\nRoads\nThe main highway leading to and within the city is the Ayalon Highway (Highway 20), which runs in the eastern side of the city from north to south along the Ayalon River riverbed. Driving south on Ayalon gives access to Highway 4 leading to Ashdod, Highway 1, leading to Ben Gurion International Airport and Jerusalem and Highway 431 leading to Jerusalem, Modiin, Rehovot and the Highway 6 Trans-<this country> Highway. Driving north on Ayalon gives access to the Highway 2 coastal road leading to Netanya, Hadera and Haifa. Within the city, main routes include Kaplan Street, Allenby Street, Ibn Gabirol Street, Dizengoff Street, Rothschild Boulevard, and in Jaffa the main route is Jerusalem Boulevard. Namir Road connects the city to Highway 2, <this country>'s main north\u2013south highway, and Begin/Jabotinsky Road, which provides access from the east through Ramat Gan, Bnei Brak and Petah Tikva. <this city>, accommodating about 500,000 commuter cars daily, suffers from increasing congestion. In 2007, the Sadan Report recommended the introduction of a congestion charge similar to that of London in <this city> as well as other <this country>i cities. Under this plan, road users traveling into the city would pay a fixed fee.\n\nAir\nThe main airport serving Greater <this city> is Ben Gurion International Airport. Located in the neighbouring city of Lod, it handled over 20 million passengers in 2017. Ben Gurion is the main hub of El Al, Arkia, Israir Airlines and Sun D'Or. The airport is 15 km (9 mi) southeast of <this city>, on Highway 1 between <this city> and Jerusalem. Sde Dov (IATA: SDV), in northwestern <this city>, is a domestic airport and was closed in 2019 in favor of real-estate development. All services to Sde Dov will be transferred to Ben Gurion Airport.\n\nCycling\nThe <this city> Municipality encourages the use of bicycles in the city. Plans called for expansion of the paths to 100 km (62.1 mi) by 2009. By 2020, the city had 140 kilometres of bicycle paths with plans to reach 300 km by 2025. The city is at the center of the Ofnidan, a network of bicycle paths throughout the Gush Dan metropolitan area.\nIn April 2011, the <this city> municipality launched Tel-O-Fun, a bicycle sharing system, in which 150 stations of bicycles for rent were installed within the city limits.\n\nForeign relations\nThe municipality of <this city> signed agreements with many cities worldwide.\n\nExplanatory notes\nReferences\nGeneral bibliography\nMichael Turner, Catherine Weill-Rochant, Genevi\u00e8ve Blondiau, Silvina Sosnovsky, Philippe Brandeis, Sur les traces du modernisme, <this city>-Ha\u00effa-J\u00e9rusalem, CIVA (ed.), Bruxelles, 2004 (in Hebrew and French).\nCatherine Weill-Rochant, L'Atlas de <this city> 1908\u20132008, Paris, CNRS Editions, 2008 (historical maps and photos, French, soon in Hebrew and English).\nCatherine Weill-Rochant, Bauhaus \" \u2013 Architektur in Tel-Aviv, L'architecture \" Bauhaus \" \u00e0 <this city>, Rita Gans (\u00e9d.), Z\u00fcrich, Yad Yearim, 2008 (in German and French).\nCatherine Weill-Rochant, \"The <this city> School: a constrained rationalism\", DOCOMOMO journal (documentation and conservation of buildings, sites and neighbourhoods of the modern movement), April 2009.\nCatherine Weill-Rochant (2006).
