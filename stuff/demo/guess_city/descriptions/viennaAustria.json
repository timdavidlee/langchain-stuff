  "wiki_text": "<this city> ( (listen) vee-EN-\u0259; German: Wien [vi\u02d0n] (listen); Austro-Bavarian: Wean [ve\u0250\u032fn]) is the capital, largest city, and one of nine provinces of <this country>. <this city> is <this country>'s most populous city and its primate city, with about two million inhabitants (2.9 million within the metropolitan area, nearly one third of the country's population), and its cultural, economic, and political center. It is the 6th-largest city proper by population in the European Union and the largest of all cities on the Danube river.\nUntil the beginning of the 20th century, <this city> was the largest German-speaking city in the world, and before the splitting of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in World War I, the city had two million inhabitants. Today, it is the second-largest German-speaking city after Berlin. <this city> is host to many major international organizations, including the United Nations, OPEC and the OSCE. The city is located in the eastern part of <this country> and is close to the borders of the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. These regions work together in a European Centrope border region. Along with nearby Bratislava, <this city> forms a metropolitan region with 3 million inhabitants. In 2001, the city center was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In July 2017 it was moved to the list of World Heritage in Danger.Additionally, <this city> has been called the \"City of Music\" due to its musical legacy, as many famous classical musicians such as Beethoven and Mozart called <this city> home. <this city> is also said to be the \"City of Dreams\" because it was home to the world's first psychoanalyst, Sigmund Freud. <this city>'s ancestral roots lie in early Celtic and Roman settlements that transformed into a Medieval and Baroque city. It is well known for having played a pivotal role as a leading European music center, from the age of Viennese Classicism through the early part of the 20th century. The historic center of <this city> is rich in architectural ensembles, including Baroque palaces and gardens, and the late-19th-century Ringstra\u00dfe lined with grand buildings, monuments and parks.\n\nEtymology\nThe English name <this city> is borrowed from the homonymous Italian name. The etymology of the city's name is still subject to scholarly dispute. Some claim that the name comes from vedunia, meaning \"forest stream\", which subsequently produced the Old High German uuenia (wenia in modern writing), the New High German wien and its dialectal variant wean.Others believe that the name comes from the Roman settlement name of Celtic extraction Vindobona, probably meaning \"fair village, white settlement\" from Celtic roots, vindo-, meaning \"bright\" or \"fair\" (as in the Irish fionn and the Welsh gwyn), and -bona \"village, settlement\". The Celtic word vindos may reflect a widespread prehistorical cult of Vindos, a Celtic deity who survives in Irish mythology as the warrior and seer Fionn mac Cumhaill. A variant of this Celtic name could be preserved in the Czech, Slovak, Polish and Ukrainian names of the city (V\u00edde\u0148, Viede\u0148, Wiede\u0144 and \u0412\u0456\u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c respectively) and in that of the city's district Wieden.Another theory suggests the name comes from the Wends (Old English: Winedas; Old Norse: Vindr; German: Wenden, Winden; Danish: vendere; Swedish: vender; Polish: Wendowie; Czech: Vendov\u00e9) which is a historical name for Slavs living near Germanic settlement areas.\nThe name of the city in Hungarian (B\u00e9cs), Serbo-Croatian (Be\u010d, \u0411\u0435\u0447) and Ottoman Turkish (Turkish: Be\u00e7) has a different, probably Slavonic origin, and originally referred to an Avar fort in the area. Slovene speakers call the city Dunaj, which in other Central European Slavic languages means the river Danube, on which the city stands.\n\nHistory\nEarly history\nEvidence has been found of continuous habitation in the <this city> area since 500 BC, when Celts settled the site on the Danube. In 15 BC, the Romans fortified the frontier city they called Vindobona to guard the empire against Germanic tribes to the north.\n\nClose ties with other Celtic peoples continued through the ages. The Irish monk Saint Colman (or Koloman, Irish Colm\u00e1n, derived from colm \"dove\") is buried in Melk Abbey and Saint Fergil (Virgil the Geometer) served as Bishop of Salzburg for forty years. Irish Benedictines founded twelfth-century monastic settlements; evidence of these ties persists in the form of <this city>'s great Schottenstift monastery (Scots Abbey), once home to many Irish monks.\nIn 976, Leopold I of Babenberg became count of the Eastern March, a district centered on the Danube on the eastern frontier of Bavaria. This initial district grew into the duchy of <this country>. Each succeeding Babenberg ruler expanded the march east along the Danube, eventually encompassing <this city> and the lands immediately east. In 1145, Duke Henry II Jasomirgott moved the Babenberg family residence from Klosterneuburg in Lower <this country> to <this city>. From that time, <this city> remained the center of the Babenberg dynasty.In 1440, <this city> became the resident city of the Habsburg dynasty. It eventually grew to become the de facto capital of the Holy Roman Empire (800\u20131806) in 1437 and a cultural center for arts and science, music and fine cuisine. Hungary occupied the city between 1485 and 1490.\n\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, Christian forces twice stopped Ottoman armies outside <this city>, in the 1529 siege of <this city> and the 1683 Battle of <this city>. The Great Plague of <this city> ravaged the city in 1679, killing nearly a third of its population.\n\n<this country>n Empire and the early 20th century\nIn 1804, during the Napoleonic Wars, <this city> became the capital of the newly formed <this country>n Empire. The city continued to play a major role in European and world politics, including hosting the Congress of <this city> in 1814\u201315. The city also saw major uprisings against Habsburg rule in 1848, which were suppressed. After the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, <this city> remained the capital of what became the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The city functioned as a center of classical music, for which the title of the First Viennese School (Haydn/Mozart/Beethoven) is sometimes applied.\n\nDuring the latter half of the 19th century, <this city> developed what had previously been the bastions and glacis into the Ringstra\u00dfe, a new boulevard surrounding the historical town and a major prestige project. Former suburbs were incorporated, and the city of <this city> grew dramatically. In 1918, after World War I, <this city> became capital of the Republic of German-<this country>, and then in 1919 of the First Republic of <this country>.\nFrom the late-19th century to 1938, the city remained a center of high culture and of modernism. A world capital of music, <this city> played host to composers such as Brahms, Bruckner, Mahler and Richard Strauss. The city's cultural contributions in the first half of the 20th century included, among many, the <this city> Secession movement in art, psychoanalysis, the Second Viennese School (Schoenberg, Berg, Webern), the architecture of Adolf Loos and the philosophy of Ludwig Wittgenstein and the <this city> Circle. In 1913 Adolf Hitler, Leon Trotsky, Josip Broz Tito, Sigmund Freud and Joseph Stalin all lived within a few kilometers of each other in central <this city>, some of them becoming regulars at the same coffeehouses.\n<this country>ns came to regard <this city> as a center of socialist politics, sometimes referred to as \"Red <this city>\" (Das rote Wien). In the <this country>n Civil War of 1934 Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss sent the <this country>n Army to shell civilian housing such as the Karl Marx-Hof occupied by the socialist militia.\n\nAnschluss and World War II\nIn 1938, after a triumphant entry into <this country>, the <this country>n-born German Chancellor Adolf Hitler spoke to the <this country>n Germans from the balcony of the Neue Burg, a part of the Hofburg at the Heldenplatz. In the ensuing days the new Nazi authorities oversaw the harassment of Viennese Jews, the looting of their homes, and their on-going deportation and murder. Between 1938 (after the Anschluss) and the end of the Second World War in 1945, <this city> lost its status as a capital to Berlin, because <this country> ceased to exist and became part of Nazi Germany.\nDuring the November pogroms on November 9, 1938, 92 synagogues in <this city> were destroyed. Only the city temple in the 1st district was spared, as the data of all Jews in <this city> were collected in the adjacent archives. Adolf Eichmann held office in the expropriated Palais Rothschild and organized the expropriation and persecution of the Jews. Of the almost 200,000 Jews in <this city>, around 120,000 were driven to emigrate and around 65,000 were killed. After the end of the war, the Jewish population of <this city> was only about 5,000.<this city> was also the center of the important resistance group around Heinrich Maier, which provided the Allies with plans for V-1, V-2 rockets, Peenem\u00fcnde, Tiger tanks, Messerschmitt Bf 109, Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet and other aircraft. The information was important to Operation Crossbow and Operation Hydra, both preliminary missions for Operation Overlord. In addition, factory locations for war-essential products were communicated as targets for the Allied Air Force. The group was exposed and most of its members were executed after months of torture by the Gestapo in <this city>. The group around the later executed Karl Burian even tried to blow up the Gestapo headquarters in the Hotel Metropole.On 2 April 1945, the Soviet Red Army launched the <this city> Offensive against the Germans holding the city and besieged it. British and American air-raids, as well as artillery duels between the Red Army and the SS and Wehrmacht, crippled infrastructure, such as tram services and water- and power-distribution, and destroyed or damaged thousands of public and private buildings. The Red Army was helped by an <this country>n resistance group in the German Wehrmacht. The group tried under the code name Radetzky to prevent the destruction and fighting in the city. <this city> fell eleven days later. At the end of the war, <this country> again became separated from Germany, and <this city> regained its status as the capital city of the Republic of <this country>, but the Soviet hold on the city remained until 1955, when <this country> regained full sovereignty.\n\nFour-power <this city>\nAfter the war, <this city> was part of Soviet-occupied Eastern <this country> until September 1945. As in Berlin, <this city> in September 1945 was divided into sectors by the four powers: the US, the UK, France, and the Soviet Union and supervised by an Allied Commission. The four-power occupation of <this city> differed in one key respect from that of Berlin: the central area of the city, known as the first district, constituted an international zone in which the four powers alternated control on a monthly basis. The control was policed by the four powers on a de facto day-to-day basis, the famous \"four soldiers in a jeep\" method. The Berlin Blockade of 1948 raised Western concerns that the Soviets might repeat the blockade in <this city>. The matter was raised in the UK House of Commons by MP Anthony Nutting, who asked: \"What plans have the Government for dealing with a similar situation in <this city>? <this city> is in exactly a similar position to Berlin.\"There was a lack of airfields in the Western sectors, and authorities drafted contingency plans to deal with such a blockade. Plans included the laying down of metal landing mats at Sch\u00f6nbrunn. The Soviets did not blockade the city. The Potsdam Agreement included written rights of land access to the western sectors, whereas no such written guarantees had covered the western sectors of Berlin. Also, there was no precipitating event to cause a blockade in <this city>. (In Berlin, the Western powers had introduced a new currency in early 1948 to economically freeze out the Soviets.) During the 10 years of the four-power occupation, <this city> became a hotbed for international espionage between the Western and Eastern blocs. In the wake of the Berlin Blockade, the Cold War in <this city> took on a different dynamic. While accepting that Germany and Berlin would be divided, the Soviets had decided against allowing the same state of affairs to arise in <this country> and <this city>. Here, the Soviet forces controlled districts 2, 4, 10, 20, 21, and 22 and all areas incorporated into <this city> in 1938.\nBarbed wire fences were installed around the perimeter of West Berlin in 1953, but not in <this city>. By 1955, the Soviets, by signing the <this country>n State Treaty, agreed to relinquish their occupation zones in Eastern <this country> as well as their sector in <this city>. In exchange they required that <this country> declare its permanent neutrality after the allied powers had left the country. Thus they ensured that <this country> would not be a member of NATO and that NATO forces would therefore not have direct communications between Italy and West Germany.\nThe atmosphere of four-power <this city> is the background for Graham Greene's screenplay for the film The Third Man (1949). Later he adapted the screenplay as a novel and published it. Occupied <this city> is also depicted in the 1991 Philip Kerr novel, A German Requiem.\n\n<this country>n State Treaty and afterwards\nThe four-power control of <this city> lasted until the <this country>n State Treaty was signed in May 1955. That year, after years of reconstruction and restoration, the State Opera and the Burgtheater, both on the Ringstra\u00dfe, reopened to the public. The Soviet Union signed the State Treaty only after having been provided with a political guarantee by the federal government to declare <this country>'s neutrality after the withdrawal of the allied troops. This law of neutrality, passed in late October 1955 (and not the State Treaty itself), ensured that modern <this country> would align with neither NATO nor the Soviet bloc, and is considered one of the reasons for <this country>'s delayed entry into the European Union in 1995.\nIn the 1970s, <this country>n Chancellor Bruno Kreisky inaugurated the <this city> International Center, a new area of the city created to host international institutions. <this city> has regained much of its former international stature by hosting international organizations, such as the United Nations (United Nations Industrial Development Organization, United Nations Office at <this city> and United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime), the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization, the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.\nOn 3 November 2020, a series of shootings rocked <this city>. Four civilians were killed, including the attacker, who was identified as a sympathiser of the Islamic State.\n\nDemographics\nBecause of the industrialization and migration from other parts of the Empire, the population of <this city> increased sharply during its time as the capital of <this country>-Hungary (1867\u20131918). In 1910, <this city> had more than two million inhabitants, and was the third largest city in Europe after London and Paris. Around the start of the 20th century, <this city> was the city with the second-largest Czech population in the world (after Prague). After World War I, many Czechs and Hungarians returned to their ancestral countries, resulting in a decline in the Viennese population. After World War II, the Soviets used force to repatriate key workers of Czech, Slovak and Hungarian origins to return to their ethnic homelands to further the Soviet bloc economy. The population of <this city> generally stagnated or declined through the remainder of the 20th century, not demonstrating significant growth again until the census of 2000. In 2020, <this city>'s population remained significantly below its reported peak in 1916.\nUnder the Nazi regime, 65,000 Jews were deported and murdered in concentration camps by Nazi forces; approximately 130,000 fled.By 2001, 16% of people living in <this country> had nationalities other than <this country>n, nearly half of whom were from former Yugoslavia; the next most numerous nationalities in <this city> were Turks (39,000; 2.5%), Poles (13,600; 0.9%) and Germans (12,700; 0.8%).As of 2012, an official report from Statistics <this country> showed that more than 660,000 (38.8%) of the Viennese population have full or partial migrant background, mostly from Ex-Yugoslavia, Turkey, Germany, Poland, Romania and Hungary.From 2005 to 2015 the city's population grew by 10.1%. According to UN-Habitat, <this city> could be the fastest growing city out of 17 European metropolitan areas until 2025 with an increase of 4.65% of its population, compared to 2010.\n\nReligion\nAccording to the 2001 census, 49.2% of Viennese were Catholic, while 25.7% were of no religion, 7.8% were Muslim, 6.0% were members of an Eastern Orthodox Christian denomination, 4.7% were Protestant (mostly Lutheran), 0.5% were Jewish and 6.3% were either of other religions or did not reply. A 2011 report by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis showed the proportions had changed, with 41.3% Catholic, 31.6% no affiliation, 11.6% Muslim, 8.4% Eastern Orthodox, 4.2% Protestant, and 2.9% other. One sources estimates that <this city>'s Jewish community is of 8,000 members meanwhile another suggest 15,000.Based on information provided to city officials by various religious organizations about their membership, <this city>'s Statistical Yearbook 2019 reports in 2018 an estimated 610,269 Roman Catholics, or 32.3% of the population, and 195,000 (10.3%) Muslims, 70,298 (3.7%) Orthodox, 57,502 (3.0%) other Christians, and 9,504 (0.5%) other religions. A study conducted by the <this city> Institute of Demography estimated the 2018 proportions to be 34% Catholic, 30% unaffiliated, 15% Muslim, 10% Orthodox, 4% Protestant, and 6% other religions.As of the spring of 2014, Muslims made up 30% of the total proportion of schoolchildren in <this city>.<this city> is the seat of the Metropolitan Roman Catholic Archdiocese of <this city>, in which is also vested the exempt Ordinariate for Byzantine-Rite Catholics in <this country>; its Archbishop is Cardinal Christoph Sch\u00f6nborn. Many Catholic churches in central <this city> feature performances of religious or other music, including masses sung to classical music and organ. Some of <this city>'s most significant historical buildings are Catholic churches, including the St. Stephen's Cathedral (Stephansdom), Karlskirche, Peterskirche and the Votivkirche. On the banks of the Danube, there is a Buddhist Peace Pagoda, built in 1983 by the monks and nuns of Nipponzan Myohoji.\n\nGeography\n<this city> is located in northeastern <this country>, at the easternmost extension of the Alps in the <this city> Basin. The earliest settlement, at the location of today's inner city, was south of the meandering Danube while the city now spans both sides of the river. Elevation ranges from 151 to 542 m (495 to 1,778 ft). The city has a total area of 414.65 square kilometers (160.1 sq mi), making it the largest city in <this country> by area.\n\nClimate\n<this city> has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen classification Cfb), transitioning to a humid subtropical climate Cfa, in the urban core in recent decades, with summer average temperatures pushing over 22C/72F in July and August in the Innere Stadt. The city has warm summers, with periodical precipitations that can reach its yearly peak in July and August (66.6 and 66.5 mm respectively) and average high temperatures from June to September of approximately 21 to 27 \u00b0C (70 to 81 \u00b0F), with a record maximum exceeding 38 \u00b0C (100 \u00b0F) and a record low in September of 5.6 \u00b0C (42 \u00b0F). Winters are relatively dry and cold with average temperatures at about freezing point. Spring is variable and autumn cool, with possible snowfalls already in November. Precipitation is generally moderate throughout the year, averaging around 550 mm (21.7 in) annually, with considerable local variations, the <this city> Woods region in the west being the wettest part (700 to 800 mm (28 to 31 in) annually) and the flat plains in the east being the driest part (500 to 550 mm (20 to 22 in) annually). Snow in winter is common, even if not so frequent compared to the Western and Southern regions of <this country>.\n\nWorld heritage in danger\n<this city> was moved to the UNESCO world heritage in endangered list in 2017. The main reason was a planned high-rise development. The city's social democratic party planned construction of a 6,500 m2 (70,000 sq ft) complex in 2019. The plan includes a 66.3 m (218 ft)-high tower, which was reduced from 75 m (246 ft) due to opposition. UNESCO believed that the project \"fails to comply fully with previous committee decisions, notably concerning the height of new constructions, which will impact adversely the outstanding universal value of the site\". UNESCO set the restriction for the height of the construction in the city center to 43 m (141 ft).The citizens of <this city> also opposed the construction of the complex because they are afraid of losing UNESCO status and also of encouraging future high-rise development. The city officials replied that they will convince the WHC to maintain UNESCO world heritage status and said that no further high-rise developments are being planned.UNESCO is concerned about the height of high-rise development in <this city> as it can dramatically influence the visual integrity of the city, specifically the baroque palaces. Visual impact studies are being done in the <this city> city center to assess the level of visual disturbance to visitors and how the changes influenced the city's visual integrity.\n\nDistricts and enlargement\n<this city> is composed of 23 districts (Bezirke). Administrative district offices in <this city> (called Magistratische Bezirks\u00e4mter) serve functions similar to those in the other <this country>n states (called Bezirkshauptmannschaften), the officers being subject to the mayor of <this city>; with the notable exception of the police, which is under federal supervision.\nDistrict residents in <this city> (<this country>ns as well as EU citizens with permanent residence here) elect a District Assembly (Bezirksvertretung). City hall has delegated maintenance budgets, e.g., for schools and parks, so that the districts are able to set priorities autonomously. Any decision of a district can be overridden by the city assembly (Gemeinderat) or the responsible city councilor (amtsf\u00fchrender Stadtrat).\n\nThe heart and historical city of <this city>, a large part of today's Innere Stadt, was a fortress surrounded by fields in order to defend itself from potential attackers. In 1850, <this city> with the consent of the emperor annexed 34 surrounding villages, called Vorst\u00e4dte, into the city limits (districts no. 2 to 8, after 1861 with the separation of Margareten from Wieden no. 2 to 9). Consequently, the walls were razed after 1857, making it possible for the city center to expand.\nIn their place, a broad boulevard called the Ringstra\u00dfe was built, along which imposing public and private buildings, monuments, and parks were created by the start of the 20th century. These buildings include the Rathaus (town hall), the Burgtheater, the University, the Parliament, the twin museums of natural history and fine art, and the Staatsoper. It is also the location of New Wing of the Hofburg, the former imperial palace, and the Imperial and Royal War Ministry finished in 1913. The mainly Gothic Stephansdom is located at the center of the city, on Stephansplatz. The Imperial-Royal Government set up the <this city> City Renovation Fund (Wiener Stadterneuerungsfonds) and sold many building lots to private investors, thereby partly financing public construction works.\n\nFrom 1850 to 1890, city limits in the West and the South mainly followed another wall called Linienwall at which a road toll called the Liniengeld was charged. Outside this wall from 1873 onwards a ring road called G\u00fcrtel was built. In 1890 it was decided to integrate 33 suburbs (called Vororte) beyond that wall into <this city> by 1 January 1892 and transform them into districts no. 11 to 19 (district no. 10 had been constituted in 1874); hence the Linienwall was torn down beginning in 1894. In 1900, district no. 20, Brigittenau, was created by separating the area from the 2nd district.\nFrom 1850 to 1904, <this city> had expanded only on the right bank of the Danube, following the main branch before the regulation of 1868\u20131875, i.e., the Old Danube of today. In 1904, the 21st district was created by integrating Floridsdorf, Kagran, Stadlau, Hirschstetten, Aspern and other villages on the left bank of the Danube into <this city>, in 1910 Strebersdorf followed. On 15 October 1938 the Nazis created Great <this city> with 26 districts by merging 97 towns and villages into <this city>, 80 of which were returned to surrounding Lower <this country> in 1954. Since then <this city> has had 23 districts.\nIndustries are located mostly in the southern and eastern districts. The Innere Stadt is situated away from the main flow of the Danube, but is bounded by the Donaukanal (\"Danube canal\"). <this city>'s second and twentieth districts are located between the Donaukanal and the Danube. Across the Danube, where the <this city> International Center is located (districts 21\u201322), and in the southern areas (district 23) are the newest parts of the city.\n\nPolitics\nPolitical history\nIn the twenty years before the First World War and until 1918, Viennese politics were shaped by the Christian Social Party. In particular, long-term mayor Karl Lueger was able to not apply the general voting rights for men introduced by and for the parliament of imperial <this country>, the Reichsrat, in 1907, thereby excluding most of the working class from taking part in decisions. For Adolf Hitler, who spent some years in <this city>, Lueger was a teacher of how to use antisemitism in politics.\n<this city> is today considered the center of the Social Democratic Party (SP\u00d6). During the period of the First Republic (1918\u20131934), the <this city> Social Democrats undertook many social reforms. At that time, <this city>'s municipal policy was admired by Socialists throughout Europe, who therefore referred to the city as \"Red <this city>\" (Rotes Wien). In February 1934 troops of the <this country>n federal government under Engelbert Dollfuss, who had closed down the first chamber of the federal parliament, the Nationalrat, in 1933, and paramilitary socialist organizations were engaged in the <this country>n Civil War, which led to the ban of the Social Democratic party.\nThe SP\u00d6 has held the mayor's office and control of the city council/parliament at every free election since 1919. The only break in this SP\u00d6 dominance came between 1934 and 1945, when the Social Democratic Party was illegal, mayors were appointed by the austro-fascist and later by the Nazi authorities. The mayor of <this city> is Michael Ludwig of the SP\u00d6.\nThe city has enacted many social democratic policies. The Gemeindebauten are social housing assets that are well integrated into the city architecture outside the first or \"inner\" district. The low rents enable comfortable accommodation and good access to the city amenities. Many of the projects were built after the Second World War on vacant lots that were destroyed by bombing during the war. The city took particular pride in building them to a high standard.\n\nGovernment\nSince <this city> obtained federal state (Bundesland) status of its own by the federal constitution of 1920, the city council also functions as the state parliament (Landtag), and the mayor (except 1934\u20131945) also doubles as the Landeshauptmann (governor/minister-president) of the state of <this city>. The Rathaus accommodates the offices of the mayor (de:Magistrat der Stadt Wien) and the state government (Landesregierung). The city is administered by a multitude of departments (Magistratsabteilungen), politically supervised by Amtsf\u00fchrende Stadtr\u00e4te (members of the city government/parliament leading offices; according to the <this city> constitution opposition parties have the right to designate members of the city government not leading offices).\nUnder the city constitution of 1920, municipal and state business must be kept separate. Hence, the city council and state parliament hold separate meetings, with separate presiding officers\u2013the chairman of the city council or the president of the state Landtag\u2013even though the two bodies' memberships are identical. When meeting as a city council, the deputies can only deal with the affairs of the city of <this city>; when meeting as a state parliament, they can only deal with the affairs of the state of <this city>.\nIn the 1996 City Council election, the SP\u00d6 lost its overall majority in the 100-seat chamber, winning 43 seats and 39.15% of the vote. The SP\u00d6 had held an outright majority at every free municipal election since 1919. In 1996 the Freedom Party of <this country> (FP\u00d6), which won 29 seats (up from 21 in 1991), beat the \u00d6VP into third place for the second time running. From 1996 to 2001, the SP\u00d6 governed <this city> in a coalition with the \u00d6VP. In 2001 the SP\u00d6 regained the overall majority with 52 seats and 46.91% of the vote; in October 2005, this majority was increased further to 55 seats (49.09%). In course of the 2010 city council elections the SP\u00d6 lost their overall majority again and consequently forged a coalition with the Green Party \u2013 the first SP\u00d6/Green coalition in <this country>. This coalition was maintained following the 2015 election. Following the 2020 election, the SP\u00d6 forged a coalition with NEOS \u2013 The New <this country> and Liberal Forum.\n\nEconomy\n<this city> is one of the wealthiest regions in the European Union: Its gross regional product of EUR 47,200 per capita constituted 25.7% of <this country>'s GDP in 2013. It amounts to 159% of the EU average. The city improved its position from 2012 on the ranking of the most economically powerful cities reaching number nine on the listing in 2015.With a share of 85.5% in gross value added, the service sector is <this city>'s most important economic sector.
