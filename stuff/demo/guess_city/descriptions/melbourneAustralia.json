  "wiki_text": "<this city> ( (listen) MEL-b\u0259rn; Boonwurrung/Woiwurrung: Narrm or Naarm) is the capital of the <this country>n state of Victoria, and the second-most populous city in <this country> (although the most populous in its contiguous urban area). Its name generally refers to a 9,993 km2 (3,858 sq mi) metropolitan area known as Greater <this city>, comprising an urban agglomeration of 31 local municipalities, although the name is also used specifically for the local municipality of City of <this city> based around its central business area. The metropolis occupies much of the northern and eastern coastlines of Port Phillip Bay and spreads into the Mornington Peninsula, part of West Gippsland, as well as the hinterlands towards the Yarra Valley, the Dandenong and Macedon Ranges. It has a population over 5 million (19% of the population of <this country>, as per 2022 census), mostly residing to the east side of the city centre, and its inhabitants are commonly referred to as \"Melburnians\".The area of <this city> has been home to Aboriginal Victorians for over 40,000 years and serves as an important meeting place for local Kulin nation clans. Of the five peoples of the Kulin nation, the traditional custodians of the land encompassing <this city> are the Boonwurrung, Wathaurong and the Wurundjeri peoples. A short-lived penal settlement was built at Port Phillip, then part of the British colony of New South Wales, in 1803, but it was not until 1835, with the arrival of free settlers from Van Diemen's Land (modern-day Tasmania), that <this city> was founded. It was incorporated as a Crown settlement in 1837, and named after the then British Prime Minister, William Lamb, 2nd Viscount <this city>. In 1851, four years after Queen Victoria declared it a city, <this city> became the capital of the new colony of Victoria. During the 1850s Victorian gold rush, the city entered a lengthy boom period that, by the late 1880s, had transformed it into one of the world's largest and wealthiest metropolises. After the federation of <this country> in 1901, it served as the interim seat of government of the new nation until Canberra became the permanent capital in 1927. Today, it is a leading financial centre in the Asia-Pacific region and ranks 32nd globally in the March 2022 Global Financial Centres Index.<this city> is home to many of <this country>'s best-known landmarks, such as the <this city> Cricket Ground, the National Gallery of Victoria and the World Heritage-listed Royal Exhibition Building. Noted for its cultural heritage, the city gave rise to <this country>n rules football, <this country>n impressionism and <this country>n cinema, and has more recently been recognised as a UNESCO City of Literature and a global centre for street art, live music and theatre. It hosts major annual international events, such as the <this country>n Grand Prix and the <this country>n Open, and also hosted the 1956 Summer Olympics. <this city> consistently ranked as the world's most liveable city for much of the 2010s.<this city> Airport, also known as the Tullamarine Airport, is the second-busiest airport in <this country>, and the Port of <this city> is the nation's busiest seaport. Its main metropolitan rail terminus is Flinders Street station and its main regional rail and road coach terminus is Southern Cross station. It also has <this country>'s most extensive freeway network and the largest urban tram network in the world.\n\nHistory\nEarly history and foundation\nAboriginal <this country>ns have lived in the <this city> area for at least 40,000 years. When European colonisers arrived in the 19th century, at least 20,000 Kulin people from three distinct language groups \u2013 the Wurundjeri, Bunurong and Wathaurong \u2013 resided in the area. It was an important meeting place for the clans of the Kulin nation alliance and a vital source of food and water. In June 2021, the boundaries between the land of two of the traditional owner groups, the Wurundjeri and Bunurong, were agreed after being drawn up by the Victorian Aboriginal Heritage Council. The borderline runs across the city from west to east, with the CBD, Richmond and Hawthorn included in Wurundjeri land, and Albert Park, St Kilda and Caulfield on Bunurong land. However, this change in boundaries is still disputed by people on both sides of the dispute including N'arweet Carolyn Briggs. The name Narrm is commonly used by the broader Aboriginal community to refer to the city, stemming from the traditional name recorded for the area on which the <this city> city centre is built. The word is closely related to Narm-narm, being the Boonwurrung word for Port Phillip Bay. Narrm means scrub in Eastern Kulin languages which reflects the Creation Story of how the Bay was filled by the creation of the Birrarung (Yarra River). Before this, the dry <this city> region extended out into the Bay and the Bay was filled with teatree scrub where boordmul (emu) and marram (kangaroo) were hunted.The first British settlement in Victoria, then part of the penal colony of New South Wales, was established by Colonel David Collins in October 1803, at Sullivan Bay, near present-day Sorrento. The following year, due to a perceived lack of resources, these settlers relocated to Van Diemen's Land (present-day Tasmania) and founded the city of Hobart. It would be 30 years before another settlement was attempted.\nIn May and June 1835, John Batman, a leading member of the Port Phillip Association in Van Diemen's Land, explored the <this city> area, and later claimed to have negotiated a purchase of 2,400 km2 (600,000 acres) with eight Wurundjeri elders. However, the nature of the treaty has been heavily disputed, as none of the parties spoke the same language, and the elders likely perceived it as part of the gift exchanges which had taken place over the previous few days amounting to a tanderrum ceremony which allows temporary, not permanent, access to and use of the land. Batman selected a site on the northern bank of the Yarra River, declaring that \"this will be the place for a village\" before returning to Van Diemen's Land. In August 1835, another group of Vandemonian settlers arrived in the area and established a settlement at the site of the current <this city> Immigration Museum. Batman and his group arrived the following month and the two groups ultimately agreed to share the settlement, initially known by the native name of Dootigala.Batman's Treaty with the Aboriginal elders was annulled by Richard Bourke, the Governor of New South Wales (who at the time governed all of eastern mainland <this country>), with compensation paid to members of the association. In 1836, Bourke declared the city the administrative capital of the Port Phillip District of New South Wales, and commissioned the first plan for its urban layout, the Hoddle Grid, in 1837. Known briefly as Batmania, the settlement was named <this city> on 10 April 1837 by Governor Richard Bourke after the British Prime Minister, William Lamb, 2nd Viscount <this city>, whose seat was <this city> Hall in the market town of <this city>, Derbyshire. That year, the settlement's general post office officially opened with that name.Between 1836 and 1842, Victorian Aboriginal groups were largely dispossessed of their land by European settlers. By January 1844, there were said to be 675 Aborigines resident in squalid camps in <this city>. The British Colonial Office appointed five Aboriginal Protectors for the Aborigines of Victoria, in 1839, however, their work was nullified by a land policy that favoured squatters who took possession of Aboriginal lands. By 1845, fewer than 240 wealthy Europeans held all the pastoral licences then issued in Victoria and became a powerful political and economic force in Victoria for generations to come.Letters patent of Queen Victoria, issued on 25 June 1847, declared <this city> a city. On 1 July 1851, the Port Phillip District separated from New South Wales to become the Colony of Victoria, with <this city> as its capital.\n\nVictorian gold rush\nThe discovery of gold in Victoria in mid-1851 sparked a gold rush, and <this city>, the colony's major port, experienced rapid growth. Within months, the city's population had nearly doubled from 25,000 to 40,000 inhabitants. Exponential growth ensued, and by 1865 <this city> had overtaken Sydney as <this country>'s most populous city.An influx of intercolonial and international migrants, particularly from Europe and China, saw the establishment of slums, including Chinatown and a temporary \"tent city\" on the southern banks of the Yarra. In the aftermath of the 1854 Eureka Rebellion, mass public support for the plight of the miners resulted in major political changes to the colony, including improvements in working conditions across mining, agriculture, manufacturing and other local industries. At least twenty nationalities took part in the rebellion, giving some indication of immigration flows at the time.With the wealth brought in from the gold rush and the subsequent need for public buildings, a program of grand civic construction soon began. The 1850s and 1860s saw the commencement of Parliament House, the Treasury Building, the Old <this city> Gaol, Victoria Barracks, the State Library, University of <this city>, General Post Office, Customs House, the <this city> Town Hall, St Patrick's cathedral, though many remained incomplete for decades, with some still not finished as of 2018.The layout of the inner suburbs on a largely one-mile grid pattern, cut through by wide radial boulevards and parklands surrounding the central city, was largely established in the 1850s and 1860s. These areas rapidly filled with the ubiquitous terrace houses, as well as with detached houses and grand mansions, while some of the major roads developed as shopping streets. <this city> quickly became a major finance centre, home to several banks, the Royal Mint, and (in 1861) <this country>'s first stock exchange.\nIn 1855, the <this city> Cricket Club secured possession of its now famous ground, the MCG. Members of the <this city> Football Club codified <this country>n football in 1859, and in 1861, the first <this city> Cup race was held. <this city> acquired its first public monument, the Burke and Wills statue, in 1864.\nWith the gold rush largely over by 1860, <this city> continued to grow on the back of continuing gold-mining, as the major port for exporting the agricultural products of Victoria (especially wool) and with a developing manufacturing sector protected by high tariffs. An extensive radial railway network spread into the countryside from the late 1850s. Construction started on further major public buildings in the 1860s and 1870s, such as the Supreme Court, Government House, and the Queen Victoria Market. The central city filled up with shops and offices, workshops, and warehouses. Large banks and hotels faced the main streets, with fine townhouses in the east end of Collins Street, contrasting with tiny cottages down laneways within the blocks. The Aboriginal population continued to decline, with an estimated 80% total decrease by 1863, due primarily to introduced diseases (particularly smallpox), frontier violence and dispossession of their lands.\n\nLand boom and bust\nThe 1880s saw extraordinary growth: consumer confidence, easy access to credit, and steep increases in land prices led to an enormous amount of construction. During this \"land boom\", <this city> reputedly became the richest city in the world, and the second-largest (after London) in the British Empire.The decade began with the <this city> International Exhibition in 1880, held in the large purpose-built Exhibition Building. A telephone exchange was established that year, and the foundations of St Paul's were laid. In 1881, electric light was installed in the Eastern Market, and a generating station capable of supplying 2,000 incandescent lamps was in operation by 1882. The <this city> cable tramway system opened in 1885 and became one of the world's most extensive systems by 1890.\nIn 1885, visiting English journalist George Augustus Henry Sala coined the phrase \"Marvellous <this city>\", which stuck long into the twentieth century and has come to refer to the opulence and energy of the 1880s, during which time large commercial buildings, grand hotels, banks, coffee palaces, terrace housing and palatial mansions proliferated in the city. The establishment of the  <this city> Hydraulic Power Company in 1886 led to the availability of high-pressure piped water, allowing for the installation of hydraulically powered elevators, which led to the construction of the first high-rise buildings in the city. The period also saw the huge expansion of a significant radial rail-based transport network throughout the city and suburbs.<this city>'s land-boom peaked in 1888, the year it hosted the Centennial Exhibition. The brash boosterism that had typified <this city> during that time ended in the early 1890s. The bubble supporting the local finance and property industries burst, resulting in a severe economic depression. Sixteen small \"land banks\" and building societies collapsed, and 133 limited companies went into liquidation. The <this city> financial crisis was a contributing factor to the <this country>n economic depression of the 1890s and the <this country>n banking crisis of 1893. The effects of the depression on the city were profound, with virtually no significant construction until the late 1890s.\n\nTemporary capital of <this country> and World War II\nAt the time of <this country>'s federation on 1 January 1901 <this city> became the seat of government of the federated Commonwealth of <this country>. The first federal parliament convened on 9 May 1901 in the Royal Exhibition Building, subsequently moving to the Victorian Parliament House, where it sat until it moved to Canberra in 1927. The Governor-General of <this country> resided at Government House in <this city> until 1930, and many major national institutions remained in <this city> well into the twentieth century.During World War II the city hosted American military forces who were fighting the Empire of Japan, and the government requisitioned the <this city> Cricket Ground for military use.\n\nPost-war period\nIn the immediate years after World War II, <this city> expanded rapidly, its growth boosted by post-war immigration to <this country>, primarily from Southern Europe and the Mediterranean. While the \"Paris End\" of Collins Street began <this city>'s boutique shopping and open air cafe cultures, the city centre was seen by many as stale\u2014the dreary domain of office workers\u2014something expressed by John Brack in his famous painting Collins St., 5 pm (1955). Up until the 21st century, <this city> was considered <this country>'s \"industrial heartland\".\nHeight limits in the CBD were lifted in 1958, after the construction of ICI House, transforming the city's skyline with the introduction of skyscrapers. Suburban expansion then intensified, served by new indoor malls beginning with Chadstone Shopping Centre. The post-war period also saw a major renewal of the CBD and St Kilda Road which significantly modernised the city. New fire regulations and redevelopment saw most of the taller pre-war CBD buildings either demolished or partially retained through a policy of facadism. Many of the larger suburban mansions from the boom era were also either demolished or subdivided.\nTo counter the trend towards low-density suburban residential growth, the government began a series of controversial public housing projects in the inner city by the Housing Commission of Victoria, which resulted in the demolition of many neighbourhoods and a proliferation of high-rise towers. In later years, with the rapid rise of motor vehicle ownership, the investment in freeway and highway developments greatly accelerated the outward suburban sprawl and declining inner-city population. The Bolte government sought to rapidly accelerate the modernisation of <this city>. Major road projects including the remodelling of St Kilda Junction, the widening of Hoddle Street and then the extensive 1969 <this city> Transportation Plan changed the face of the city into a car-dominated environment.<this country>'s financial and mining booms during 1969 and 1970 resulted in establishment of the headquarters of many major companies (BHP and Rio Tinto, among others) in the city. Nauru's then booming economy resulted in several ambitious investments in <this city>, such as Nauru House. <this city> remained <this country>'s main business and financial centre until the late 1970s, when it began to lose this primacy to Sydney.<this city> experienced an economic downturn between 1989 and 1992, following the collapse of several local financial institutions. In 1992, the newly elected Kennett government began a campaign to revive the economy with an aggressive development campaign of public works coupled with the promotion of the city as a tourist destination with a focus on major events and sports tourism. During this period the <this country>n Grand Prix moved to <this city> from Adelaide. Major projects included the construction of a new facility for the <this city> Museum, Federation Square, the <this city> Convention & Exhibition Centre, Crown Casino and the CityLink tollway. Other strategies included the privatisation of some of <this city>'s services, including power and public transport, and a reduction in funding to public services such as health, education and public transport infrastructure.\n\nContemporary <this city>\nSince the mid-1990s, <this city> has maintained significant population and employment growth. There has been substantial international investment in the city's industries and property market. Major inner-city urban renewal has occurred in areas such as Southbank, Port <this city>, <this city> Docklands and more recently, South Wharf. <this city> sustained the highest population increase and economic growth rate of any <this country>n capital city from 2001 to 2004.From 2006, the growth of the city extended into \"green wedges\" and beyond the city's urban growth boundary. Predictions of the city's population reaching 5 million people pushed the state government to review the growth boundary in 2008 as part of its <this city> @ Five Million strategy. In 2009, <this city> was less affected by the late-2000s financial crisis in comparison to other <this country>n cities. At this time, more new jobs were created in <this city> than any other <this country>n city\u2014almost as many as the next two fastest growing cities, Brisbane and Perth, combined, and <this city>'s property market remained highly priced, resulting in historically high property prices and widespread rent increases. In 2020, <this city> was classified as an Alpha city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. Out of all major <this country>n cities, <this city> was the worst affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and spent a long time under lockdown restrictions, with <this city> experiencing six lockdowns totalling 262 days. Whilst this contributed to a net outflow of migration causing a slight reduction in <this city>'s population over the course of 2020 to 2022, <this city> is projected to be the fastest growing capital city in <this country> from 2023-24 onwards, overtaking Sydney as the nation's largest city in 2029-30 at just over 5.9 million, exceeding 6 million people the following year. These forecasts are despite the city recording a decline in population during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nGeography\n<this city> is in the southeastern part of mainland <this country>, within the state of Victoria. Geologically, it is built on the confluence of Quaternary lava flows to the west, Silurian mudstones to the east, and Holocene sand accumulation to the southeast along Port Phillip. The southeastern suburbs are situated on the Selwyn fault, which transects Mount Martha and Cranbourne. The western portion of the metropolitan area lies within the Victorian Volcanic Plain grasslands vegetation community, and the southeast falls in the Gippsland Plains Grassy Woodland zone.<this city> extends along the Yarra River towards the Yarra Valley and the Dandenong Ranges to the east. It extends northward through the undulating bushland valleys of the Yarra's tributaries\u2014Moonee Ponds Creek (toward Tullamarine Airport), Merri Creek, Darebin Creek and Plenty River\u2014to the outer suburban growth corridors of Craigieburn and Whittlesea.\nThe city reaches southeast through Dandenong to the growth corridor of Pakenham towards West Gippsland, and southward through the Dandenong Creek valley and the city of Frankston. In the west, it extends along the Maribyrnong River and its tributaries north towards Sunbury and the foothills of the Macedon Ranges, and along the flat volcanic plain country towards Melton in the west, Werribee at the foothills of the You Yangs granite ridge southwest of the CBD. The Little River, and the township of the same name, marks the border between <this city> and neighbouring Geelong city.\n<this city>'s major bayside beaches are in the various suburbs along the shores of Port Phillip Bay, in areas like Port <this city>, Albert Park, St Kilda, Elwood, Brighton, Sandringham, Mentone, Frankston, Altona, Williamstown and Werribee South. The nearest surf beaches are 85 km (53 mi) south of the <this city> CBD in the back-beaches of Rye, Sorrento and Portsea.\n\nClimate\n<this city> has a temperate oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfb) with warm summers and cool winters. <this city> is well known for its changeable weather conditions, mainly due to it being located on the boundary of hot inland areas and the cool southern ocean. This temperature differential is most pronounced in the spring and summer months and can cause strong cold fronts to form. These cold fronts can be responsible for varied forms of severe weather from gales to thunderstorms and hail, large temperature drops and heavy rain. Winters, while exceptionally dry by south central Victorian standards, are nonetheless drizzly and overcast. The lack of winter rainfall is owed to <this city>'s rain shadowed location between the Otway and Macedon Ranges, which block much of the rainfall arriving from the north and west.\nPort Phillip is often warmer than the surrounding oceans and/or the land mass, particularly in spring and autumn; this can set up a \"bay effect\", similar to the \"lake effect\" seen in colder climates, where showers are intensified leeward of the bay. Relatively narrow streams of heavy showers can often affect the same places (usually the eastern suburbs) for an extended period, while the rest of <this city> and surrounds stays dry. Overall, the area around <this city> is, owing to its rain shadow, nonetheless significantly drier than average for southern Victoria. Within the city and surrounds, rainfall varies widely, from around 425 mm (17 in) at Little River to 1,250 mm (49 in) on the eastern fringe at Gembrook. <this city> receives 48.6 clear days annually. Dewpoint temperatures in the summer range from 9.5 to 11.7 \u00b0C (49.1 to 53.1 \u00b0F).<this city> is also prone to isolated convective showers forming when a cold pool crosses the state, especially if there is considerable daytime heating. These showers are often heavy and can include hail, squalls, and significant drops in temperature, but they often pass through very quickly with a rapid clearing trend to sunny and relatively calm weather and the temperature rising back to what it was before the shower. This can occur in the space of minutes and can be repeated many times a day, giving <this city> a reputation for having \"four seasons in one day\", a phrase that is part of local popular culture. The lowest temperature on record is \u22122.8 \u00b0C (27.0 \u00b0F), on 21 July 1869. The highest temperature recorded in <this city> city was 46.4 \u00b0C (115.5 \u00b0F), on 7 February 2009. While snow is occasionally seen at higher elevations in the outskirts of the city, and dustings were observed in 2020, it has not been recorded in the Central Business District since 1986.The average temperature of the sea ranges from 14.6 \u00b0C (58.3 \u00b0F) in September to 18.8 \u00b0C (65.8 \u00b0F) in February; at Port <this city>, the average sea temperature range is the same.\n\nUrban structure\n<this city>'s urban area is approximately 2,704 km2, the largest in <this country> and the 33rd largest in the world. The Hoddle Grid, a grid of streets measuring approximately 1 by 1\u20442 mi (1.61 by 0.80 km), forms the nucleus of <this city>'s central business district (CBD). The grid's southern edge fronts onto the Yarra River. More recent office, commercial and public developments in the adjoining districts of Southbank and Docklands have made these areas into extensions of the CBD in all but name. A byproduct of the CBD's layout is its network of lanes and arcades, such as Block Arcade and Royal Arcade.<this city>'s CBD has become <this country>'s most densely populated area, with approximately 19,500 residents per square kilometre, and is home to more skyscrapers than any other <this country>n city, the tallest being <this country> 108, situated in Southbank. <this city>'s newest planned skyscraper, Southbank By Beulah (also known as \"Green Spine\"), has recently been approved for construction and will be the tallest structure in <this country> by 2025.\nThe CBD and surrounds also contain many significant historic buildings such as the Royal Exhibition Building, the <this city> Town Hall and Parliament House.\nAlthough the area is described as the centre, it is not actually the demographic centre of <this city> at all, due to an urban sprawl to the southeast, the demographic centre being located at Glen Iris.\n<this city> is typical of <this country>n capital cities in that after the turn of the 20th century, it expanded with the underlying notion of a 'quarter acre home and garden' for every family, often referred to locally as the <this country>n Dream. This, coupled with the popularity of the private automobile after 1945, led to the auto-centric urban structure now present today in the middle and outer suburbs. Much of metropolitan <this city> is accordingly characterised by low-density sprawl, whilst its inner-city areas feature predominantly medium-density, transit-oriented urban forms. The city centre, Docklands, St. Kilda Road and Southbank areas feature high-density forms.\n<this city> is often referred to as <this country>'s garden city, and the state of Victoria was once known as the garden state. There is an abundance of parks and gardens in <this city>, many close to the CBD with a variety of common and rare plant species amid landscaped vistas, pedestrian pathways and tree-lined avenues. <this city>'s parks are often considered the best public parks in all of <this country>'s major cities. There are also many parks in the surrounding suburbs of <this city>, such as in the municipalities of Stonnington, Boroondara and Port Phillip, southeast of the central business district. Several national parks have been designated around the urban area of <this city>, including the Mornington Peninsula National Park, Port Phillip Heads Marine National Park and Point Nepean National Park in the southeast, Organ Pipes National Park to the north and Dandenong Ranges National Park to the east. There are also a number of significant state parks just outside <this city>. The extensive area covered by urban <this city> is formally divided into hundreds of suburbs (for addressing and postal purposes), and administered as local government areas, 31 of which are located within the metropolitan area.\n\nHousing\n<this city> has minimal public housing and high demand for rental housing, which is becoming unaffordable for some. Public housing is managed and provided by the Victorian Government's Department of Families, Fairness and Housing, and operates within the framework of the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement, by which both federal and state governments provide funding for housing.\n<this city> is experiencing high population growth, generating high demand for housing. This housing boom has increased house prices and rents, as well as the availability of all types of housing. Subdivision regularly occurs in the outer areas of <this city>, with numerous developers offering house and land packages. However, since the release of <this city> 2030 in 2002, planning policies have encouraged medium-density and high-density development in existing areas with good access to public transport and other services. As a result of this, <this city>'s middle and outer-ring suburbs have seen significant brownfields redevelopment.\n\nArchitecture\nOn the back of the 1850s gold rush and 1880s land boom, <this city> became renowned as one of the world's great Victorian-era cities, a reputation that persists due to its diverse range of Victorian architecture. High concentrations of well-preserved Victorian-era buildings can be found in the inner suburbs, such as Carlton, East <this city> and South <this city>. Outstanding examples of <this city>'s built Victorian heritage include the World Heritage-listed Royal Exhibition Building (1880), the General Post Office (1867), Hotel Windsor (1884) and the Block Arcade (1891). Comparatively little remains of <this city>'s pre-gold rush architecture; St James Old Cathedral (1839) and St Francis' Church (1845) are among the few examples left in the CBD. Many of the CBD's Victorian boom-time landmarks were also demolished in the decades after World War II, including the Federal Coffee Palace (1888) and the APA Building (1889), one of the tallest early skyscrapers upon completion. Heritage listings and heritage overlays have since been introduced in an effort to prevent further losses of the city's historic fabric.\n\nIn line with the city's expansion during the early 20th century, suburbs such as Hawthorn and Camberwell are defined largely by Federation and Edwardian architectural styles. The City Baths, built in 1903, are a prominent example of the latter style in the CBD. The 1926 Nicholas Building is the city's grandest example of the Chicago School style, while the influence of Art Deco is apparent in the Manchester Unity Building, completed in 1932.\nThe city also features the Shrine of Remembrance, which was built as a memorial to the men and women of Victoria who served in World War I and is now a memorial to all <this country>ns who have served in war.\nResidential architecture is not defined by a single architectural style, but rather an eclectic mix of large McMansion-style houses (particularly in areas of urban sprawl), apartment buildings, condominiums, and townhouses which generally characterise the medium-density inner-city neighbourhoods. Freestanding dwellings with relatively large gardens are perhaps the most common type of housing outside inner city <this city>. Victorian terrace housing, townhouses and historic Italianate, Tudor revival and Neo-Georgian mansions are all common in inner-city neighbourhoods such as Carlton, Fitzroy and further into suburban enclaves like Toorak.\n\nCulture\nOften referred to as <this country>'s cultural capital, <this city> is recognised globally as a centre of sport, music, theatre, comedy, art, literature, film and television. For much of the 2010s, it held the top position in The Economist Intelligence Unit's list of the world's most liveable cities, partly due to its cultural attributes.The city celebrates a wide variety of annual cultural events and festivals of all types, including the <this city> International Arts Festival, <this city> International Comedy Festival, <this city> Fringe Festival and Moomba, <this country>'s largest free community festival.\nThe State Library of Victoria, founded in 1854, is one of the world's oldest free public libraries and, as of 2018, the fourth most-visited library globally. Between the gold rush and the crash of 1890, <this city> was <this country>'s literary capital, famously referred to by Henry Kendall as \"that wild bleak Bohemia south of the Murray\". At this time, <this city>-based writers and poets Marcus Clarke, Adam Lindsay Gordon and Rolf Boldrewood produced classic visions of colonial life. Fergus Hume's The Mystery of a Hansom Cab (1886), the fastest-selling crime novel of the era, is set in <this city>, as is <this country>'s best-selling book of poetry, C. J. Dennis' The Songs of a Sentimental Bloke (1915). Contemporary <this city> authors who have written award-winning books set in the city include Peter Carey, Helen Garner and Christos Tsiolkas. <this city> has <this country>'s widest range of bookstores, as well as the nation's largest publishing sector. The city is also home to the <this city> Writers Festival and hosts the Victorian Premier's Literary Awards. In 2008, it became the second city to be named a UNESCO City of Literature.\n\nRay Lawler's play Summer of the Seventeenth Doll is set in Carlton and debuted in 1955, the same year that Edna Everage, Barry Humphries' Moonee Ponds housewife character, first appeared on stage, both sparking international interest in <this country>n theatre. <this city>'s East End Theatre District is known for its Victorian era theatres, such as the Athenaeum, Her Majesty's and the Princess, as well as the Forum and the Regent.
