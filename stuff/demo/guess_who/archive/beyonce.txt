Known as "Queen Bey", she has been widely recognized for her boundary-pushing artistry and vocal performances. Beyoncé is regarded as one of the greatest entertainers of her generation. Her contributions to music and visual media have made her an influential pop culture figure of the 21st century.

Beyoncé started performing in various singing and dancing competitions as a child. She rose to fame in the late 1990s as a member of the R&B girl group Destiny's Child, one of the best-selling girl groups of all time. Their hiatus saw the release of her debut album Dangerously in Love (2003). She then released the commercially successful solo albums B'Day (2006), I Am... Sasha Fierce (2008), and 4 (2011). In the late 2010s, Beyoncé's artistry achieved widespread acclaim for releasing the sonically experimental visual albums Beyoncé (2013) and Lemonade (2016), which explored multiple societal themes such as infidelity, feminism, and womanism. Following the acclaimed LGBT-inspired dance album Renaissance (2022), she became the first solo artist to have their first seven studio albums debut at number one in the U.S.

Some of Beyoncé's most notable songs include "Crazy in Love", "Baby Boy", "Irreplaceable", "If I Were a Boy", "Halo", "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)", "Run the World (Girls)", "Love On Top", "Drunk in Love", "Formation", "Break My Soul", and "Cuff It." Her collaborative music ventures include Everything Is Love (2018), an album with her husband Jay-Z, as the Carters, and the musical film Black Is King (2020), inspired by the music of the film soundtrack The Lion King: The Gift (2019). Outside of music, she has starred as an actress in multiple films such as Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002), The Pink Panther (2006), Dreamgirls (2006), Cadillac Records (2008), Obsessed (2009), and The Lion King (2019).
