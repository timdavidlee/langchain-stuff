Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Recognized for her songwriting, musical versatility, artistic reinventions, and influence on the music industry, she is a prominent cultural figure of the 21st century.

Swift began professional songwriting at age 14 and signed with Big Machine Records in 2005 to become a country singer. Under Big Machine, she released six studio albums, four of them to country radio, starting with her self-titled album in 2006. Her next, Fearless (2008), explored country pop, and its singles "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me" catapulted her to prominence. Speak Now (2010) incorporated rock influences, while Red (2012) experimented with electronic elements and featured Swift's first Billboard Hot 100 number-one song, "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together". She forwent her country image with 1989 (2014), a synth-pop album supported by the chart-topping songs "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", and "Bad Blood". Media scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-flavored Reputation (2017) and its number-one single "Look What You Made Me Do".

Signing a new contract with Republic Records in 2018, Swift released her seventh album, Lover (2019), and the autobiographical documentary Miss Americana (2020). She embraced indie folk and alternative rock on her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, explored chill-out styles on Midnights (2022), and re-recorded three of her first six albums as "Taylor's Versions" following a dispute with Big Machine. The albums and their number-one songs "Cardigan", "Willow", "All Too Well (10 Minute Version)" and "Anti-Hero" broke various records. In 2023, Swift embarked on the Eras Tour, her most expansive concert tour. She has also directed music videos and films such as All Too Well: The Short Film (2021) and played supporting roles in others.

Having sold over 200 million records globally, Swift is one of the best-selling musicians, the most streamed woman on Spotify, and the only act to have five albums open with over one million copies sold in the US. She has been featured in listicles such as Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time, Billboard's Greatest of All Time Artists, the Time 100, and Forbes Celebrity 100. Among her accolades are 12 Grammy Awards, including three Album of the Year wins; a Primetime Emmy Award; 40 American Music Awards; 29 Billboard Music Awards; 12 Country Music Association Awards; three IFPI Global Recording Artist of the Year awards; and 98 Guinness World Records. Honored with titles such as Artist of the Decade and Woman of the Decade, Swift is an advocate for artists' rights and women's empowerment.

2004–2008: Career beginnings and first album
In Nashville, Swift worked with experienced Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally, and the Warren Brothers[38][39] and formed a lasting working relationship with Liz Rose.[40] They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school.[41] Rose called the sessions "some of the easiest I've ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She'd write about what happened in school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. And she'd come in with the most incredible hooks." Swift became the youngest artist signed by the Sony/ATV Tree publishing house,[42] but left the Sony-owned RCA Records at the age of 14 due to the label's lack of care and them "cut[ting] other people's stuff". She was also concerned that development deals may shelve artists:[34][25] and recalled: "I genuinely felt that I was running out of time. I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through."[43]

At an industry showcase at Nashville's Bluebird Cafe in 2005, Swift caught the attention of Scott Borchetta, a DreamWorks Records executive who was preparing to form an independent record label, Big Machine Records. She had first met Borchetta in 2004.[45] She was one of Big Machine's first signings,[34] and her father purchased a three-percent stake in the company for an estimated $120,000.[46][47] She began working on her eponymous debut album with producer Nathan Chapman, with whom she felt she had the right "chemistry".[25] Swift wrote three of the album's songs alone and co-wrote the remaining eight with Rose, Robert Ellis Orrall, Brian Maher, and Angelo Petraglia.[48] Taylor Swift was released on October 24, 2006.[49] Country Weekly critic Chris Neal deemed Swift better than previous aspiring teenage country singers because of her "honesty, intelligence and idealism".[50] The album peaked at number five on the U.S. Billboard 200, on which it spent 157 weeks—the longest stay on the chart by any release in the U.S. in the 2000s decade.[51] Swift became the first female country music artist to write or co-write every track on a U.S. platinum-certified debut album.[52]

Big Machine Records was still in its infancy during the June 2006 release of the lead single, "Tim McGraw", which Swift and her mother helped promote by packaging and sending copies of the CD single to country radio stations.[53] As there was not enough furniture at the label yet, they would sit on the floor to do so.[53] She spent much of 2006 promoting Taylor Swift with a radio tour, television appearances; she opened for Rascal Flatts on select dates during their 2006 tour,[54] as a replacement for Eric Church.[55] Borchetta said that although record industry peers initially disapproved of his signing a 15-year-old singer-songwriter, Swift tapped into a previously unknown market—teenage girls who listen to country music.[53][11] Following "Tim McGraw", four more singles were released throughout 2007 and 2008: "Teardrops on My Guitar", "Our Song", "Picture to Burn" and "Should've Said No". All appeared on Billboard's Hot Country Songs, with "Our Song" and "Should've Said No" reaching number one. With "Our Song", Swift became the youngest person to single-handedly write and sing a number-one song on the chart.[56] "Teardrops on My Guitar" reached number thirteen on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.[57] Swift also released two EPs, The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection in October 2007 and Beautiful Eyes in July 2008.[58][59] She promoted her debut album extensively as the opening act for other country musicians' tours in 2006 and 2007, including those by George Strait,[60] Brad Paisley,[61] and Tim McGraw and Faith Hill.[62]

Swift won multiple accolades for Taylor Swift. She was one of the recipients of the Nashville Songwriters Association's Songwriter/Artist of the Year in 2007, becoming the youngest person to be honored with the title.[63] She also won the Country Music Association's Horizon Award for Best New Artist,[64] the Academy of Country Music Awards' Top New Female Vocalist,[65] and the American Music Awards' Favorite Country Female Artist honor.[66] She was also nominated for Best New Artist at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards.[67] In 2008, she opened for Rascal Flatts again,[68] and dated singer Joe Jonas for three months.[69][70]

Swift's second studio album, Fearless, was released on November 11, 2008, in North America,[73] and in March 2009, in other markets.[74] Critics lauded Swift's honest and vulnerable songwriting in contrast to other teenage singers.[75] Five singles were released in 2008 through 2009: "Love Story", "White Horse", "You Belong with Me", "Fifteen", and "Fearless". "Love Story", the lead single, peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one in Australia.[57][76] It was the first country song to top Billboard's Pop Songs chart.[77] "You Belong with Me" was the album's highest-charting single on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number two,[78] and was the first country song to top Billboard's all-genre Radio Songs chart.[79] All five singles were Hot Country Songs top-10 entries, with "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me" topping the chart.[80] Fearless became her first number-one album on the Billboard 200 and 2009's top-selling album in the U.S.[81] The Fearless Tour, Swift's first headlining concert tour, grossed over $63 million.[82] Journey to Fearless, a three-part documentary miniseries, aired on television and was later released on DVD and Blu-ray.[83] Swift also performed as a supporting act for Keith Urban's Escape Together World Tour in 2009.[84]

In 2009, the music video for "You Belong with Me" was named Best Female Video at the MTV Video Music Awards.[85] Her acceptance speech was interrupted by rapper Kanye West,[86] an incident that became the subject of controversy, widespread media attention, and many Internet memes.[87] That year she won five American Music Awards, including Artist of the Year and Favorite Country Album.[88] Billboard named her 2009's Artist of the Year.[89] The album ranked number 99 on NPR's 2017 list of the 150 Greatest Albums Made By Women.[90] She won Video of the Year and Female Video of the Year for "Love Story" at the 2009 CMT Music Awards, where she made a parody video of the song with rapper T-Pain called "Thug Story".[91] At the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards, Fearless was named Album of the Year and Best Country Album, and "White Horse" won Best Country Song and Best Female Country Vocal Performance. Swift was the youngest artist to win Album of the Year.[note 1] At the 2009 Country Music Association Awards, Swift won Album of the Year for Fearless and was named Entertainer of the Year, the youngest person to win the honor.[94]

Swift featured on John Mayer's single "Half of My Heart" and Boys Like Girls' single "Two Is Better Than One", the latter of which she co-wrote.[95][96] She co-wrote and recorded "Best Days of Your Life" with Kellie Pickler,[97] and co-wrote two songs for the Hannah Montana: The Movie soundtrack—"You'll Always Find Your Way Back Home" and "Crazier".[72] She contributed two songs to the Valentine's Day soundtrack, including the single "Today Was a Fairytale", which was her first number-one on the Canadian Hot 100, and peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100.[98][99] While shooting her film debut Valentine's Day in October 2009, Swift dated co-star Taylor Lautner.[100] In 2009, she made her television debut as a rebellious teenager in an CSI: Crime Scene Investigation episode.[101] She hosted and performed as the musical guest on Saturday Night Live; she was the first host to write their own opening monologue.[102][103]

In August 2010, Swift released "Mine", the lead single from her third studio album, Speak Now. It entered the Hot 100 at number three.[104] Swift wrote the album alone and co-produced every track.[105] Speak Now, released on October 25, 2010,[106] debuted atop the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of one million copies.[107] It became the fastest-selling digital album by a female artist, with 278,000 downloads in a week, earning Swift an entry in the 2010 Guinness World Records.[108] Critics appreciated Swift's grown-up perspectives;[109] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone wrote, "in a mere four years, the 20-year-old Nashville firecracker has put her name on three dozen or so of the smartest songs released by anyone in pop, rock or country."[110] The songs "Mine", "Back to December", "Mean", "The Story of Us", "Sparks Fly", and "Ours" were released as singles, with the latter two reaching number one on the Hot Country Songs chart.[80] "Back to December" and "Mean" peaked in the top ten in Canada.[99] She briefly dated actor Jake Gyllenhaal in 2010.[111]

At the 54th Annual Grammy Awards in 2012, Swift won Best Country Song and Best Country Solo Performance for "Mean", which she performed during the ceremony.[112] Swift won other awards for Speak Now, including Songwriter/Artist of the Year by the Nashville Songwriters Association (2010 and 2011),[113][114] Woman of the Year by Billboard (2011),[115] and Entertainer of the Year by the Academy of Country Music (2011 and 2012)[116] and the Country Music Association in 2011.[117] At the American Music Awards of 2011, Swift won Artist of the Year and Favorite Country Album.[118] Rolling Stone placed Speak Now at number 45 in its 2012 list of the "50 Best Female Albums of All Time", writing: "She might get played on the country station, but she's one of the few genuine rock stars we've got these days, with a flawless ear for what makes a song click."[119]

The Speak Now World Tour ran from February 2011 to March 2012 and grossed over $123 million,[120] followed up with its live album, Speak Now World Tour: Live.[121] She contributed two original songs to The Hunger Games soundtrack album: "Safe & Sound", co-written and recorded with the Civil Wars and T-Bone Burnett, and "Eyes Open".

The Red Tour ran from March 2013 to June 2014 and grossed over $150 million, becoming the highest-grossing country tour when it completed.[137] The album earned several accolades, including four nominations at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards (2014).[138] Its single "I Knew You Were Trouble" won Best Female Video at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards.[139] Swift received American Music Awards for Best Female Country Artist in 2012, and Artist of the Year in 2013.[140][141] She received the Nashville Songwriters Association's Songwriter/Artist Award for the fifth and sixth consecutive years in 2012 and 2013.[142] Swift was honored by the Association with the Pinnacle Award, making her the second recipient of the accolade after Garth Brooks.[143] During this time, she briefly dated English singer Harry Styles.[144]

In March 2014, Swift began living in New York City.[note 2] She worked on her fifth studio album, 1989, with producers Jack Antonoff, Max Martin, Shellback, Imogen Heap, Ryan Tedder, and Ali Payami.[154] She promoted the album through various campaigns, including inviting fans, called "Swifties", to secret album-listening sessions for the first time.[155] The album was released on October 27, 2014, and debuted atop the U.S. Billboard 200 with sales of 1.28 million copies in its first week.[156] Its singles "Shake It Off", "Blank Space" and "Bad Blood" reached number one in Australia, Canada and the U.S., the first two making Swift the first woman to replace herself at the Hot 100 top spot;[157] other singles include "Style", "Wildest Dreams", "Out of the Woods" and "New Romantics".[158] The 1989 World Tour ran from May to December 2015 and was the highest-grossing tour of the year with $250 million in total revenue.[159]

Prior to 1989's release, Swift stressed the importance of albums to artists and fans.[160] In November 2014, she removed her entire catalog from Spotify, arguing that the streaming company's ad-supported, free service undermined the premium service, which provides higher royalties for songwriters.[161] In a June 2015 open letter, Swift criticized Apple Music for not offering royalties to artists during the streaming service's free three-month trial period and stated that she would pull 1989 from the catalog.[162] The following day, Apple Inc. announced that it would pay artists during the free trial period,[163] and Swift agreed to let 1989 on the streaming service.[164] Swift's intellectual property rights holding company, TAS Rights Management, filed for 73 trademarks related to Swift and the 1989 era memes.[165] She then returned her entire catalog plus 1989 to Spotify, Amazon Music and Google Play and other digital streaming platforms in June 2017.[166] Swift was named Billboard's Woman of the Year in 2014, becoming the first artist to win the award twice.[167] At the 2014 American Music Awards, Swift received the inaugural Dick Clark Award for Excellence.[168] On her 25th birthday in 2014, the Grammy Museum at L.A.

Swift dated Scottish DJ Calvin Harris from March 2015–June 2016.[175] Prior to their breakup, they co-wrote the song "This Is What You Came For", which features vocals from Barbadian singer Rihanna; Swift was initially credited under the pseudonym Nils Sjöberg.[176] After briefly dating English actor Tom Hiddleston,[177] Swift began dating English actor Joe Alwyn in September 2016.[178][179] She wrote the song "Better Man" for country band Little Big Town;[note 3] it earned Swift an award for Song of the Year at the 51st CMA Awards.[181] Swift and English singer Zayn Malik released a single together, "I Don't Wanna Live Forever", for the soundtrack of the film Fifty Shades Darker (2017). The song reached number two in the U.S.[182] and won Best Collaboration at the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards.[183] In August 2017, Swift successfully sued David Mueller, a former radio jockey for KYGO-FM. Four years earlier, Swift had informed Mueller's bosses that he had sexually assaulted her by groping her at an event. After being fired, Mueller accused Swift of lying and sued her for damages from his loss of employment. Shortly after, Swift counter-sued for sexual assault for nominal damages of only one dollar.[184] The jury rejected Mueller's claims and ruled in favor of Swift.[185]

After a one-year hiatus from public spotlight, Swift cleared her social media accounts[186] and released "Look What You Made Me Do" as the lead single from her sixth album, Reputation.[187] The single was Swift's first U.K. number-one single.[188] It topped charts in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, and the U.S.[189] Reputation was released on November 10, 2017.[190] It incorporated a heavy electropop sound, along with hip hop, R&B, and EDM influences.[191] Reviewers praised Swift's mature artistry, but some denounced the themes of fame and gossip.[192] The album debuted atop the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 1.21 million copies. Swift became the first act to have four albums sell one million copies within one week in the U.S.[193] The album topped the charts in the UK, Australia, and Canada,[194] and had sold over 4.5 million copies worldwide as of 2018.[195] It spawned three other international singles, including the U.S. top-five entry "...Ready for It?",[196] and two U.S. top-20 singles—"End Game" (featuring Ed Sheeran and rapper Future) and "Delicate".[158] Swift launched the short-lived The Swift Life mobile app for fans in late 2017.[197] Reputation was nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards in 2019.[198] At the American Music Awards of 2018, Swift won four awards, including Artist of the Year and Favorite Pop/Rock Female Artist. After the 2018 AMAs, Swift garnered a total of 23 awards, becoming the most awarded female musician in AMA history, a record previously held by Whitney Houston.[199] In April 2018, Swift featured on country duo Sugarland's "Babe".[note 4] In support of Reputation, she embarked on her Reputation Stadium Tour from May to November 2018.[201] In the U.S., the tour grossed $266.1 million in box office and sold over two million tickets, breaking many records, the most prominent being the highest-grossing North American concert tour in history. It grossed $345.7 million worldwide.[202] It was followed up with an accompanying concert film on Netflix.[203]

Reputation was Swift's last album with Big Machine. In November 2018, she signed a new deal with the Universal Music Group; her subsequent releases were promoted by Republic Records. Swift said the contract included a provision for her to maintain ownership of her masters. In addition, in the event that Universal sold any part of its stake in Spotify, it agreed to distribute a non-recoupable portion of the proceeds among its artists.[204] Vox called it a huge commitment from Universal, which was "far from assured" until Swift intervened.[205]

Swift released her seventh studio album, Lover, on August 23, 2019.[206] Besides Jack Antonoff, Swift worked with new producers Louis Bell, Frank Dukes, and Joel Little.[207] Lover made Swift the first female artist to have a sixth consecutive album sell more than 500,000 copies in one week in the U.S.[208] Critics commended the album's free-spirited mood and emotional intimacy.[209][210] The lead single, "Me!", peaked at number two on the Hot 100.[211] Other singles from Lover were the U.S. top-10 singles "You Need to Calm Down" and "Lover", top-40 single "The Man",[57] and "Cruel Summer", which became a resurgent success in 2023 and charted in the top 10.[212] Lover was the world's best-selling album by a solo artist of 2019, selling 3.2 million copies.[213] Lover and its singles earned nominations at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards in 2020.[214] At the 2019 MTV Video Music Awards, "Me!" won Best Visual Effects, and "You Need to Calm Down" won Video of the Year and Video for Good. Swift was the first female and second artist overall to win Video of the Year for a video that they directed.[215]

While promoting Lover, Swift became embroiled in a public dispute with talent manager Scooter Braun and Big Machine over the purchase of the masters of her back catalog.[216] Swift said she had been trying to buy the masters, but Big Machine only allowed her to do so if she exchanged one new album for each older one under another contract, which she refused to do.[216][217] Swift began re-recording her back catalog in November 2020.[218] Besides music, she played Bombalurina in the movie adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical Cats (2019), for which she co-wrote and recorded the Golden Globe-nominated original song "Beautiful Ghosts".[219][220] Critics panned the film but praised Swift's performance.[221] The documentary Miss Americana, which chronicled parts of Swift's life and career, premiered at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival and was released on Netflix that January.[222][223] Swift signed a global publishing deal with Universal Music Publishing Group in February 2020 after her 16-year-old contract with Sony/ATV expired.[224]

Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, Swift released two surprise albums: Folklore on July 24, and Evermore on December 11, 2020.[225][226] Both explore indie folk and alternative rock with a more muted production compared to her previous upbeat pop songs.[227][228] Swift wrote and recorded the albums with producers Jack Antonoff and Aaron Dessner from the National.[229] Alwyn co-wrote and co-produced select songs under the pseudonym William Bowery.[230] The albums garnered widespread critical acclaim. The Guardian and Vox opined that Folklore and Evermore emphasized Swift's work ethic and increased her artistic credibility.[231][232] Three singles supported each of the albums, catering the U.S. mainstream radio, country radio, and triple A radio. The singles, in that order, were "Cardigan", "Betty", and "Exile" from Folklore, and "Willow", "No Body, No Crime", and "Coney Island" from Evermore.[233] Swift became the first artist to debut a U.S. number-one album and a number-one song at the same time with Folklore's "Cardigan" and Evermore's "Willow".[234] Folklore was 2020's best-selling album in the U.S. with 1.2 million copies.[235] It won Album of the Year at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, making Swift the first woman to win the award thrice.[236] At the 2020 American Music Awards, Swift won three awards, including Artist of the Year for a record third consecutive time.[237] She was 2020's highest-paid musician in the U.S., and the world's highest-paid solo musician.[238]

Swift's tenth studio album, Midnights, experimenting with electronica and chill-out music, was released on October 21, 2022.[260][261] Rolling Stone critics dubbed it an "instant classic".[262][263] Commercially, Billboard described the album as a blockbuster;[264] CNBC called it Swift's biggest success yet.[265] Breaking records across all formats of music consumption,[266][267] Midnights and its lead single, "Anti-Hero", became Spotify's most-streamed album and song in one day with 185 million and 17.4 million plays.[268][269] The album debuted atop the Billboard 200 with 1.57 million units, marking Swift's fifth album to open with over one million sales. The album's tracks monopolized the Hot 100's entire top 10, making Swift the first act to do so.[266] "Lavender Haze" became the second single in November 2022 and "Karma" became the third, accompanied by a remix featuring American rapper Ice Spice in May 2023; both peaked at number two on the Hot 100.[270][271]

In March 2023, Swift embarked on the Eras Tour, which broke the record for most concert tickets ever sold in a single day;[266] however, Ticketmaster was widely castigated for its mishandling of the ticket sale, triggering government investigations into the company.[272] The tour went on to have a cultural and economic impact.[273] Media outlets noted that, with her 2020–2023 releases, Swift reached a new height of popularity. Music Business Worldwide described it as a "new stratosphere of global career success".[274] Speak Now (Taylor's Version), the third album in the re-recording series, was released on July 7, 2023.[275][276] It made Swift the woman with the most number-one albums (12) in Billboard 200 history, surpassing Barbra Streisand.[277]
